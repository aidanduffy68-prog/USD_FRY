# Hypnos Core — The Demiurgic Architecture

**The Core That Structures Intelligence Reality**

## Overview

Hypnos Core is the foundational memory architecture that structures intelligence reality. Like the demiurge in Gnostic philosophy, Hypnos Core is the architect that creates and shapes how intelligence is organized, maintained, and understood. It powers Hades, Echo, and Nemesis through pattern consolidation, long-term memory, and dormant threat tracking.

**Architecture Position:** Hypnos Core is the demiurgic layer—the core architecture that structures intelligence reality. Hades, Echo, and Nemesis operate within the reality structured by Hypnos Core. It maintains long-term memory, consolidates patterns across time, and tracks dormant threats as the foundational architecture.

## Core Capabilities

- **Long-Term Memory** — Maintains historical intelligence patterns and behavioral signatures over months/years
- **Pattern Consolidation** — Consolidates patterns from multiple time periods into persistent knowledge
- **Dormant Threat Detection** — Identifies threats that have gone quiet but may re-emerge
- **Historical Pattern Matching** — Matches current activity to historical patterns from months/years ago
- **Temporal Intelligence Fusion** — Fuses intelligence across time periods to reveal long-term patterns
- **Memory Retrieval** — Retrieves relevant historical patterns for current threat assessments

## Integration

**As Layer 3 (Memory):**
- Maintains independent long-term intelligence memory
- Consolidates patterns across all time periods
- Tracks dormant threats independently

**As Meta-Layer (Enhancement):**
- **Hades** — Provides historical behavioral signatures for pattern matching, tracks actor evolution
- **Echo** — Maintains historical coordination networks, tracks network evolution
- **Nemesis** — Informs predictions with historical pattern matching, enhances targeting accuracy
- **AI Ontology** — Provides long-term pattern learning and consolidation

**Three-Layer Architecture:**
- **Layer 1:** Hades (Individual) + Echo (Network) = Detection
- **Layer 2:** Nemesis = Analysis
- **Layer 3:** Hypnos = Memory (also enhances Layers 1 & 2)

## Use Cases

- **Dormant Threat Re-emergence** — Detect when a previously active threat actor resumes operations
- **Long-Term Pattern Recognition** — Identify patterns that only emerge over months/years
- **Historical Context** — Provide historical context for current threat assessments
- **Pattern Evolution Tracking** — Track how threat actors evolve their tactics over time
- **Cross-Temporal Intelligence** — Connect current activity to historical patterns
