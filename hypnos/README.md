# Hypnos — Long-Term Memory & Pattern Consolidation Engine

**AI-Powered Historical Intelligence & Dormant Threat Detection**

## Overview

Hypnos is the long-term memory and pattern consolidation engine (Layer 3) that maintains historical intelligence, tracks dormant threats, and consolidates behavioral patterns over extended time periods. Like sleep consolidates memories, Hypnos consolidates threat intelligence patterns into long-term knowledge that informs current assessments.

**Architecture Position:** Hypnos operates as both Layer 3 (Memory) and a meta-layer that enhances Layer 1 (Hades/Echo) and Layer 2 (Nemesis) with historical intelligence.

## Core Capabilities

- **Long-Term Memory** — Maintains historical intelligence patterns and behavioral signatures over months/years
- **Pattern Consolidation** — Consolidates patterns from multiple time periods into persistent knowledge
- **Dormant Threat Detection** — Identifies threats that have gone quiet but may re-emerge
- **Historical Pattern Matching** — Matches current activity to historical patterns from months/years ago
- **Temporal Intelligence Fusion** — Fuses intelligence across time periods to reveal long-term patterns
- **Memory Retrieval** — Retrieves relevant historical patterns for current threat assessments

## Integration

**As Layer 3 (Memory):**
- Maintains independent long-term intelligence memory
- Consolidates patterns across all time periods
- Tracks dormant threats independently

**As Meta-Layer (Enhancement):**
- **Hades** — Provides historical behavioral signatures for pattern matching, tracks actor evolution
- **Echo** — Maintains historical coordination networks, tracks network evolution
- **Nemesis** — Informs predictions with historical pattern matching, enhances targeting accuracy
- **AI Ontology** — Provides long-term pattern learning and consolidation

**Three-Layer Architecture:**
- **Layer 1:** Hades (Individual) + Echo (Network) = Detection
- **Layer 2:** Nemesis = Analysis
- **Layer 3:** Hypnos = Memory (also enhances Layers 1 & 2)

## Use Cases

- **Dormant Threat Re-emergence** — Detect when a previously active threat actor resumes operations
- **Long-Term Pattern Recognition** — Identify patterns that only emerge over months/years
- **Historical Context** — Provide historical context for current threat assessments
- **Pattern Evolution Tracking** — Track how threat actors evolve their tactics over time
- **Cross-Temporal Intelligence** — Connect current activity to historical patterns
