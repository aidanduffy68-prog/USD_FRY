## Why It Exists

Government agencies already spend tens of millions on crypto intelligence. They receive forensic reports that arrive days late. The Adversarial Behavior Compiler (ABC) sits on top of existing vendors (Chainalysis, TRM, Chaos, research feeds) and compiles their telemetry into actor playbooks that answer the question Treasury actually asks: **"What happens next, and how do we stop it?"**

### The Broken Loop (Status Quo)
```
Agency request → single-vendor contract → historical forensics → 7-day analyst merge → "Here's what happened."
```

### The GH Systems Loop
```
Agency request → multi-vendor feeds → ABC runtime compiles in <500 ms → "Here's what happens in 48h; here's how to stop it."
```

ABC does not replace forensics vendors—it makes them 10× more valuable to government customers.

## Recent Highlights

- **AI-Powered Threat Ontology** – ABC is now an AI-powered threat ontology that learns, evolves, and provides deeper intelligence than rule-based systems.
- **On-Chain Cryptographic Receipts** – Everything proprietary stays off-chain. Only minimal cryptographic proofs go on-chain, turning intelligence into verifiable objects usable everywhere.
- **Whitepaper v1.0** – Complete technical specification with Bitcoin settlement layer, integration models, and FY2026 competitive timeline.
- **Bitcoin settlement layer** – Agencies post BTC bounties; vendors receive payouts automatically when intelligence validates.
- **Threat actor dossiers** – `nemesis/threat_profiles/` (ex: Lazarus) provide operational playbooks with Hades/Echo/Nemesis outputs.
- **Visual assets** – `echo/visuals/` includes ABC pipeline, behavioral graph, BTC settlement flow, and operational metrics.

### Outcomes (Validated)
- **100% OFAC wallet detection** – flagged 3–6 months before public sanction designation.
- **Investigation compression** – analysts reduced triage from 7 days to ~5 hours with compiled actor packages.
- **Risk reduction (modeled)** – Treasury desks projected up to 50% lower DeFi exposure once Hades and Nemesis throttled high-risk interactions.
- **Inter-agency ROI (pilot estimate)** – federated mesh users observed 37% fewer duplicated investigations and 22% less capital-at-risk.
- **Bitcoin bounty validation** – Treasury posted 10 BTC bounty; ABC submitted package; funds released automatically within 4 hours (vs. 18-month traditional procurement).

## How ABC Works (Quick View)

1. **Signal intake** — ingest Chainalysis/TRM/Chaos/external research outputs.
2. **Hades** — compile raw telemetry into actor signatures & risk posture.
3. **Echo** — surface coordination networks with confidence/provenance.
4. **Nemesis** — generate executable targeting packages ("freeze Exchange_A/B within 24h; confidence 0.84").
5. **Cryptographic receipts** — generate minimal on-chain proofs (hash, timestamp, signature) without revealing proprietary systems.
6. **Bitcoin settlement** — agencies post BTC bounties; vendors receive payouts automatically when intelligence validates.
7. **Output** — APIs, mesh connectors, or air-gapped delivery for Treasury, OFAC, FinCEN, DoD Cyber Command, allies.

**Hypnos Core** is the demiurgic architecture—the core that structures intelligence reality. Built on Hypnos Core, Hades profiles behavior, Echo detects coordination, and Nemesis generates targeting packages. Hypnos Core maintains long-term memory, consolidates patterns, and tracks dormant threats as the foundational architecture (see `hypnos/` for details).

### On-Chain Strategy

**Everything proprietary stays off-chain. Only tiny cryptographic proofs go on-chain.**

- **Off-Chain:** All AI models, full intelligence packages, proprietary systems
- **On-Chain:** Minimal cryptographic receipts (hash, timestamp, signature, minimal metadata)

This turns intelligence into **verifiable objects** that can be used everywhere—beyond settlements, into workflows. Intelligence becomes portable, trustworthy, and usable in any system. See `nemesis/on_chain_receipt/` for implementation.

## AI-Powered Threat Ontology

ABC is not just a compiler—it's an **AI-powered threat ontology** that:

- **Learns** – Semantic understanding extracts entities from unstructured intelligence
- **Classifies** – Auto-classification categorizes threat actors, TTPs, and campaigns
- **Infers** – Graph neural networks discover hidden relationships
- **Predicts** – Forecasts adversary actions before they occur
- **Evolves** – Continuous learning improves from feedback and new data

See `nemesis/AI_THREAT_ONTOLOGY_SPEC.md` for complete architecture.

## Integration & Commercial Models

GH Systems does not compete with existing vendors—it amplifies them.

- **White-label license** ($100K–$300K/yr) → vendors upsell predictive intelligence (e.g., $2M → $3.5M contracts, ROI >600%).
- **Revenue-share overlay** (~30% of contract uplift) → no upfront cost for research firms.
- **Strategic partnerships** → joint bids combining forensics + behavioral targeting (e.g., $5M contracts).

**Time to value:** 1–2 months for API/schema alignment, 2–3 months for live pilot, enhanced contracts by month 6.

### Integration Scenarios
- **Performance Bounty** – Treasury posts 10 BTC bounty; ABC submits validated package; funds release automatically within 4 hours (vs. 18-month procurement cycle).
- **Vendor Revenue Share** – Chainalysis $2M contract → $3.5M with ABC; split 70/30; quarterly BTC settlements.
- **Allied Coordination Fund** – US Treasury + UK FIU + EU AML establish 100 BTC joint pool; 2-of-3 multisig payouts for cross-border intelligence.

### Why Integrate Now: FY2026 Competitive Window
- **Q4 2025 (now):** FY2026 contract decisions underway. First vendor integrating ABC wins premium contracts; others remain forensic-only.
- **Q1 2026:** FY2026 awards finalized—too late to integrate; late adopters wait until FY2027 (18-month disadvantage).
- **Integration timeline:** 4–6 months (API alignment + pilot). Decisions by December 2025 capture FY2026 renewal cycle.

**Window for competitive advantage:** immediate through FY2026 decisions (12–18 months head start). After awards, predictive intelligence becomes expected, not premium.

## Legacy Work: FRY Behavioral Oracle

The FRY Protocol laid the groundwork: behavioral oracles predicting trader retention (42% vs. 0% baseline) across 13,659 liquidations. Core assets now live in `hades/` and continue to inform Hades/Echo methodology.
