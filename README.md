## ⚡ Quick Summary (TL;DR)

ABC is an AI-driven ingestion engine that compiles raw threat telemetry (Chainalysis, TRM, Research Feeds) into actionable targeting packages in **<500ms**. It replaces manual, 7-day analyst workflows with a real-time, automated graph pipeline.

### Key Engineering Features:

- **Behavioral Graph**: Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to identify hidden clusters between hostile wallets
- **Event-Driven Pipeline**: Asynchronous ingestion system handling multi-source intelligence feeds
- **Deterministic Schemas**: Strict Pydantic models ensuring data integrity across the "Semantic Layer"
- **Cryptographic Provenance**: Merkle-tree based hashing to create on-chain proofs of intelligence snapshots
