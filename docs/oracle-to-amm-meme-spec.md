# Meme/Cartoon Spec: "From Oracle to AMM" Transition

## Placement
Right before the "From Oracle to AMM: Automating Retention at Scale" section in the Mirror article.

## Concept Options

### Option 1: Drake Meme Format
**Top panel (Drake disapproving):**
- "Predicting BTC/USD"
- Image: Traditional oracle crystal ball

**Bottom panel (Drake approving):**
- "Predicting if you'll come back"
- Image: Reverse oracle mirror

### Option 2: Expanding Brain Meme
**Small brain:** "Price oracles"
**Medium brain:** "Behavior oracles"
**Large brain:** "Retention AMM"
**Galaxy brain:** "Self-regulating retention economics"

### Option 3: Two Buttons Meme
**Character sweating over two buttons:**
- Button 1: "Measure asset prices"
- Button 2: "Measure trader behavior"
**Caption:** "Crypto in 2025"

### Option 4: Is This a Pigeon? Meme
**Character pointing at butterfly:** "Trader retention data"
**Caption:** "Is this an oracle?"

### Option 5: Custom Cartoon (Recommended)
**Panel 1:** Traditional oracle (crystal ball) looking at charts
- Caption: "I predict BTC will hit $100k"

**Panel 2:** Reverse oracle (mirror) looking at trader
- Caption: "I predict you'll quit after liquidation"

**Panel 3:** Both oracles shaking hands
- Caption: "Together we build the Retention AMM"

## Style
- Simple line art (black and white or minimal color)
- Frutiger Aero aesthetic if using color (blue/white/bubbles)
- Clean, professional but playful
- Should take 30 seconds to understand

## Why This Works
- Breaks up dense technical content
- Visual metaphor for oracle → AMM transition
- Memorable hook for social sharing
- Shows you don't take yourself too seriously

## Recommended: Option 5 (Custom Cartoon)
Most aligned with your brand. Shows the conceptual progression from traditional oracle → reverse oracle → retention AMM in a simple visual story.
