# üèõÔ∏è Narcissus & Echo: Behavioral Intelligence Platform

**The First Cross-Chain Behavioral Oracle**

---

## üéØ The Problem

**$50B+ behavioral intelligence market has no cross-chain solution:**
- Exchanges lose 82% of liquidated traders
- No system predicts trader behavior from liquidation events
- Behavioral patterns are siloed to individual chains
- Trading alpha from psychology patterns is untapped

---

## üèõÔ∏è The Solution: Narcissus & Echo

**Three-layer behavioral intelligence platform:**

### 1. Narcissus Oracle (Self-Reflection Engine)
Traders gaze at their liquidation reflections and see their true behavioral patterns:
- **Narcissus Score**: Self-obsession with trading (risk + deception + pattern repetition)
- **Self-Deception Level**: Gap between perceived and actual skill
- **True Risk Tolerance**: What traders actually do vs. what they think they do
- **Oracle Insights**: Predictive wisdom about future behavior

### 2. Echo Engine (Pattern Propagation)
Behavioral patterns echo across traders, time, and chains:
- **Echo Clusters**: Groups of traders with similar patterns
- **Echo Amplifiers**: Patterns that spread (high contagion risk)
- **Echo Dampeners**: Patterns that die out (isolated behaviors)
- **Echo Coherence**: How similar traders in a pattern are

### 3. Cross-Chain Detector (Universal Patterns)
Universal behavioral intelligence across blockchain networks:
- **Cross-Chain Correlations**: Behavioral correlation between chains
- **Universal Patterns**: Patterns appearing across multiple chains
- **Echo Transmission Paths**: How patterns spread from chain to chain
- **Transmission Speed**: How fast patterns propagate
