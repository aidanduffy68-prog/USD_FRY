Hi Meredith,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I really enjoyed learning more about Stork's approach to oracle infrastructure and how you're positioning against the push oracle incumbents.

As promised, here are the key links to my work:

**October 10 Market Structure Analysis:**

This breaks down the oracle failure, market maker withdrawal, and ADL cascades that amplified a $60M manipulation into $19.3B in liquidations. It's the piece I mentioned that builds on @yq_acc's research.

**FRY Protocol (Live on Arbitrum):**

- Contract: 0x492397d5912C016F49768fBc942d894687c5fe33

FRY is the retention infrastructure layer I mentionedâ€”processing post-liquidation engagement to reduce the 82% attrition rate.

I'm excited about the possibility of helping Stork educate the market on why pull oracles and multi-source aggregation matter. October 10 is a perfect case study for the problems you're solving.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
