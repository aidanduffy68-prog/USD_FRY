## Post for Tomorrow (with Visual)

Shipped: Behavioral Liquidity Mining üß†

We're not just tracking retention anymore. We're extracting trading alpha from trader psychology patterns.

The insight: Liquidation events create behavioral "fingerprints"‚Äîrecovery speed, risk tolerance, platform loyalty, trading consistency.

4 behavioral patterns we detect:
‚Ä¢ Alpha Traders: High recovery + high risk + consistency
‚Ä¢ Retention Candidates: Platform loyalty + conservative shift
‚Ä¢ Arbitrageurs: Cross-platform activity + low loyalty
‚Ä¢ Sentiment Leaders: Social influence + recovery speed

Same infrastructure serves dual purposes:
‚Üí Retention Oracle: Measure who returns (42% vs 0% control group)
‚Üí Behavioral Liquidity Mining: Predict who generates alpha

Early validation: 22 wallets tracked, pattern detection engine live, infrastructure validated with 50+ wallet demo.

One dataset. Two revenue streams.
