# LinkedIn Post: Oracle Attack Analysis

## Post Copy (with oracle_linkedin.png visual)

$60M turned into $19.3B in losses.

Not through market collapse. Through oracle failure.

October 10, 2025 was the 5th major oracle manipulation attack since 2020:

• bZx (2020): $350K
• Harvest (2020): $24M  
• Compound (2020): $89M
• Mango (2022): $117M
• October 2025: $19.3B

Same vulnerability. Bigger scale. Five years of lessons ignored.

**The pattern:**

Single-venue price feeds + Real-time spot prices + No circuit breakers = Cascading liquidations

A $60M USDe dump on one exchange triggered oracle markdowns across the entire system. Prices moved dramatically on one venue while staying stable everywhere else. 1.6M traders liquidated based on prices that existed nowhere else in the market.

**The result:**

322× amplification factor. $19.3 billion destroyed. 82% of liquidated traders quit forever.

I just published a deep-dive analyzing:

→ Why market makers executed coordinated withdrawal (not panic)
→ How oracle failure triggered the cascade
→ Why ADL destroyed sophisticated hedged positions
→ What Variational and Lighter are building to fix Layer 1
→ Why FRY Protocol is the missing Layer 3 (retention infrastructure)

Building on research by @yq_acc, this breaks down the market structure failures that enabled October 10—and why we need three layers of infrastructure to survive the next crisis.

## Alternative Shorter Version

Five oracle attacks. Five years. Same vulnerability.

$60M manipulation → $19.3B destroyed (322× amplification)

October 10, 2025 wasn't overleveraged traders getting rekt. It was oracle failure at institutional scale.

I just published a deep-dive on what really happened—oracle manipulation, market maker withdrawal, ADL cascades—and why we need retention infrastructure to survive the next crisis.

Building on @yq_acc's research.
