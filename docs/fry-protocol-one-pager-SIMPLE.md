## The Real Question

**Do you even need a PDF right now?**

What you actually need for Monday:
- ✅ LinkedIn post (you have it)
- ✅ X thread (already posted)
- ✅ Dashboard (live)
- ✅ GitHub (updated)

**The PDF is for cold outreach later.** Don't let it block Monday launch.

**Recommendation:** Skip the PDF for now. Launch Monday with what you have. Make the PDF next week when you're doing Drift/Vertex outreach.

Or use the Markdown → PDF converter for a quick version in 5 minutes.

Your call. 🍟
