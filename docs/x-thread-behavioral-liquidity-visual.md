Shipped: Behavioral Liquidity Mining 🧠

Liquidation events create behavioral fingerprints. We extract trading alpha from trader psychology patterns.

4 patterns: Alpha traders, Retention candidates, Arbitrageurs, Sentiment leaders.

Same infrastructure → retention + alpha extraction.

The architecture:

Liquidation events → Pattern detection → Alpha signals

4 behavioral patterns:
• Alpha traders (high recovery + risk)
• Retention candidates (loyalty + conservative)
• Arbitrageurs (cross-platform + consistency)
• Sentiment leaders (social influence)

Early results: 22 wallets, 42% vs 0% retention

## Alternative Tweet 2 (More Technical)
```
How it works:

22 wallets tracked → Behavioral fingerprints extracted → 4 pattern types detected

Each pattern predicts different trader behavior:
- Who generates alpha
- Who stays loyal
- Who arbitrages
- Who influences sentiment

Same infra serves retention + alpha extraction

Visual breakdown:

Liquidation events → Pattern detection engine → Alpha signals

Early validation: 22 wallets tracked, 42% vs 0% control group retention

Same infrastructure serves dual purposes:
→ Retention oracle
→ Alpha extraction

## Recommendation

**Use the first version (simple + clear):**
- Clean architecture explanation
- Lists the 4 patterns
- Shows early results
- Not too wordy

**Character count: 268** (under 280 limit)
