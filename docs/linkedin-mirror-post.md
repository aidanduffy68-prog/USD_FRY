# LinkedIn Post: Market Structure Analysis

## Post Copy

I just published a deep-dive on what really happened October 10, 2025.

Spoiler: It wasn't overleveraged traders getting rekt.

**The Real Story:**

→ Oracle failure: $60M manipulation → $19.3B destroyed (322× amplification)
→ Market makers executed coordinated withdrawal (not panic)
→ ADL forcibly closed profitable hedges, leaving traders exposed
→ Result: 1.6M liquidations, 82% quit forever

Building on research by @yq_acc, I break down:

• Why market makers optimize for chaos over stability
• How the 5th oracle attack since 2020 went unlearned
• Why sophisticated traders with hedged positions got destroyed
• What Variational and Lighter are building to fix Layer 1
• Why FRY Protocol is the missing Layer 3 (retention infrastructure)

**The uncomfortable truth:**

When those responsible for orderly markets profit more from chaos than stability, chaos becomes inevitable.

**The solution:**

Three layers of infrastructure:
1. Liquidity provision (prevent the vacuum)
2. Risk management (mitigate the damage)
3. Retention infrastructure (catch traders after both fail)

We're building Layer 3.

"Great analysis. I just published a complementary piece on the market structure failures that enabled this—oracle manipulation + market maker withdrawal + ADL cascades. Would love your thoughts: https://mirror.xyz/0xf551aF8d5373B042DBB9F0933C59213B534174e4/i8FZxbZRcqG8IVG6AWyMC3TvMmSYFeG1Q3QDrfGZUp0"
