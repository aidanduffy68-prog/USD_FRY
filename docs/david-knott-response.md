# Response to David Knott

## His Key Points

1. **TradFi Precedent**: Alternative data sources (ML scores, behavioral metrics) for underwriting
2. **Fairness Concerns**: Adverse impact testing - bias toward high/low activity traders could be controversial
3. **Community Engagement**: Wants to know community feedback
4. **Positive**: Appreciates creativity and innovation

## Response Draft (Minimal)

Hey David,

Really appreciate you engaging on this.

On community: Discord/Telegram are tough to navigate. What's the best way to get technical feedback from the right people? Forum post? Direct outreach?

Running Oct 10 analysis via Allium. Happy to share results wherever makes sense.

Best,
Aidan

## Alternative: Shorter Version

Hey David,

Great points. Quick clarifications:

**Fairness:** Retention oracle doesn't affect liquidation decisions—only triggers *after* liquidation. No adverse selection in who gets liquidated (that's purely price-based). The "bias" toward high-LTV traders is intentional—same as credit card retention offers.

**Community:** Discord is massive, hard to get traction. Posted on X/LinkedIn but early days (Part 2 just dropped yesterday). Open to suggestions on best venue for structured feedback—forum post? AMA?

**Next:** Running analysis on Oct 10 data via Allium to validate predictions. Will share results.

Thanks for the thoughtful response. Really appreciate you engaging on this.

Best,
Aidan

## Key Takeaways

**This is a GOOD response:**
- He read both articles (engagement!)
- Thoughtful critique (fairness/bias)
- Asking about community validation (wants to see traction)
- Positive tone ("appreciate your willingness to be creative")

**What he's really asking:**
"Show me this has community support before I consider it seriously"

**Your move:**
1. Respond to his fairness concerns (clarify oracle doesn't affect liquidations)
2. Acknowledge community engagement is early
3. Offer to do structured community discussion
4. Promise to share Oct 10 data analysis

**Don't oversell.** He's interested but wants validation. Show him you're willing to do the work to prove it.
