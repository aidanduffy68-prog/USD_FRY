# Tweet: Verifiable Scoring Primitives

## Option 1: Direct & Technical
```
Built verifiable scoring primitives today. Risk scores, behavioral signatures, and threat assessments are now cryptographically provable on-chain—without revealing proprietary methods.

Intelligence becomes verifiable objects. Trust without exposure.

#GHSystems #CryptoIntel
```

## Option 2: Problem → Solution
```
Black-box risk scores are a trust problem.

Today: All scoring primitives are cryptographically verifiable on-chain. Proof of authenticity without revealing proprietary methods.

Intelligence becomes verifiable objects.

#GHSystems
```

## Option 3: Short & Punchy
```
Verifiable scoring primitives: Risk scores, behavioral signatures, threat assessments—all cryptographically provable on-chain.

Trust without exposure. Intelligence becomes verifiable objects.

#GHSystems #CryptoIntel
```

## Option 4: Developer-Focused
```
Just shipped: Verifiable scoring primitives.

Every risk score, behavioral signature, and threat assessment gets a cryptographic receipt on-chain. Verifiable without revealing proprietary methods.

Intelligence = verifiable objects.

#GHSystems
```

## Option 5: Value Prop Focus
```
Three advantages: Faster settlement, shorter investigations, verifiable primitives.

Today's work: Scoring primitives are cryptographically provable. Risk scores, behavioral signatures, threat assessments—all verifiable on-chain without revealing proprietary methods.

#GHSystems
```

## Recommendation: **Option 2**

**Why:**
- Opens with the problem (black-box trust issue)
- Shows the solution (cryptographically verifiable)
- Clear value (trust without exposure)
- Memorable closing line
- Professional but accessible

## Disruption Tweet (Government BTC + Traditional Firms)

### Option 1: Direct Disruption
```
Traditional intel firms: Black-box scores, 18-month procurement, 7-day investigations.

GH Systems: Verifiable primitives, 4-hour BTC settlement, 5-hour investigations.

As governments accumulate more BTC, crypto-native intelligence becomes the only viable model.

Traditional firms can't compete.

#GHSystems
```

### Option 2: Value Prop + Disruption
```
Three advantages that disrupt traditional intel firms:

1. Faster settlement (4h BTC vs 18mo procurement)
2. Shorter investigations (5h vs 7 days)
3. Verifiable primitives (crypto receipts vs black-box scores)

As governments accumulate more BTC, crypto-native becomes the only viable model.

#GHSystems
```

### Option 3: Government BTC Focus
```
Governments are accumulating more BTC. Traditional intel firms still use 18-month procurement cycles.

We built crypto-native intelligence: 4-hour BTC settlement, verifiable scoring primitives, 5-hour investigations.

The disruption is inevitable.

#GHSystems
```

### Option 4: Problem → Solution → Disruption
```
Traditional intel firms: Black-box scores, slow procurement, fragmented reports.

Today: Verifiable scoring primitives. All risk scores, behavioral signatures, and threat assessments are cryptographically provable on-chain.

As governments accumulate more BTC, crypto-native intelligence becomes the only viable model.

Traditional firms can't compete.

#GHSystems
```

### Option 5: Short & Punchy
```
Traditional intel: Black-box scores, 18mo procurement, 7-day investigations.

GH Systems: Verifiable primitives, 4h BTC settlement, 5h investigations.

Governments are accumulating more BTC. Crypto-native intelligence wins.

#GHSystems
```

## Recommendation: **Option 4**

**Why:**
- Sets up the contrast (traditional vs. GH Systems)
- Highlights today's work (verifiable primitives)
- Connects to government BTC accumulation trend
- Clear disruption narrative
- Professional but assertive
