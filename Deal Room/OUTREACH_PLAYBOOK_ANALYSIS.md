# Outreach Playbook Analysis

**Current Status:** Low response rate, automated rejections  
**Date:** 2025-11-21

---

## Normal Playbook (Based on Strategy Docs)

### 1. White-Label Licensing
- **Target:** Research firms (Chainalysis, TRM, etc.)
- **Model:** $100K-$300K/yr licensing
- **Value Prop:** Transform "forensic reports" → "predictive intelligence platform"
- **ROI:** >600% for them ($500K → $1.5M contracts)
- **Status:** Cold outreach → automated rejections

### 2. Revenue Share
- **Target:** Cash-strapped research firms
- **Model:** 30% of contract uplift, no upfront cost
- **Value Prop:** Only pays if they win
- **Status:** Low engagement

### 3. Performance Bounties
- **Target:** Government agencies (Treasury, DoD, etc.)
- **Model:** BTC bounties, 4-hour automated settlement
- **Value Prop:** 10 BTC bounty → ABC submits package → funds release automatically
- **Status:** Not actively pursuing

## Why Outreach Isn't Working

### The Problem
- **ATS filters:** Non-traditional background gets filtered out
- **Automated rejections:** Chainalysis/Blockaid don't understand what you're building
- **Cold outreach:** No warm intro, no credibility signal
- **Mismatch:** You're building something different, they're hiring for traditional roles

### The Pattern
1. Apply to traditional security roles
2. Get automated rejection
3. Try outreach
4. No response
5. Repeat

**Insight:** You're trying to fit into their system instead of making them come to you.

## What You're Actually Doing (Bug Bounties)

### Current Activity
- Bug bounties on NASA websites (for fun)
- Finding vulnerabilities in federal infrastructure
- Demonstrating capability through action

### Strategic Value (You're Not Leveraging)
- **Proof of capability:** You're actually doing federal AI security work
- **Credibility signal:** Real vulnerabilities found, real analysis done
- **Differentiation:** Most people just apply; you're building and demonstrating

---

## The Real Playbook (What Should Work)

### 1. Build in Public → Let Them Come to You
**Instead of:** Cold outreach to companies  
**Do:** Build ABC, publish threat dossiers, demonstrate capability

**Examples:**
- NASA-001 dossier (federal AI security)
- ALPHA_47 dossier (crypto intelligence)
- GitHub repo with real code
- Whitepaper with technical depth

**Why it works:**
- Demonstrates capability (not just claims)
- Builds credibility (real work, not resumes)
- Filters for people who get it (they find you)

### 2. Leverage Bug Bounty Work Strategically
**Instead of:** "Just doing it for fun"  
**Do:** Frame it as federal AI security intelligence capability

**What you have:**
- Real vulnerabilities found on NASA infrastructure
- Real analysis done (NASA-001 dossier)
- Real proof of capability (7-day → 5-hour compilation)

**How to leverage:**
- Reference in outreach: "I've been analyzing federal AI infrastructure vulnerabilities (NASA-001 dossier)"
- Build more dossiers: DoD, DHS, Treasury AI systems
- Position as proof of capability, not just "bug bounties"

### 3. Performance Bounties (The Real Playbook)
**Instead of:** Applying to jobs  
**Do:** Post BTC bounties for intelligence, let agencies come to you

**Model:**
- Treasury posts 10 BTC bounty for AI threat intelligence
- You submit NASA-001 dossier
- Funds release automatically (4 hours)
- No procurement cycle, no job application

**Why it works:**
- Direct value exchange (intelligence for BTC)
- No ATS filters, no automated rejections
- Proves capability through delivery
- Aligns with your actual business model

### 4. Strategic Partnerships (Not Cold Outreach)
**Instead of:** Cold LinkedIn messages  
**Do:** Build relationships through shared work

**Examples:**
- Contribute to open-source security tools
- Publish research that vendors reference
- Speak at conferences (if you can)
- Build relationships with people who get it

**Why it works:**
- Warm introductions vs. cold outreach
- Credibility through shared work
- Filters for people who understand your approach

## The Shift: From "Applying" to "Building"

### Old Playbook (Not Working)
1. Apply to traditional security roles
2. Get automated rejection
3. Try outreach
4. No response
5. Frustration

### New Playbook (What Should Work)
1. Build ABC (threat dossiers, code, whitepaper)
2. Demonstrate capability (NASA bug bounties → federal AI security intelligence)
3. Publish work (GitHub, dossiers, research)
4. Let them come to you (performance bounties, partnerships, referrals)
5. Filter for people who get it (not trying to convince people who don't)

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Reframe Bug Bounty Work
**Current:** "Just doing bug bounties for fun"  
**New:** "Building federal AI security intelligence capability through vulnerability research"

**Leverage:**
- NASA-001 dossier is proof of capability
- Bug bounties = real vulnerability research
- Federal AI security = new vertical

### 2. Build More Dossiers
**Target:** DoD, DHS, Treasury AI systems  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate capability, build portfolio  
**Outcome:** More proof points, more credibility

### 3. Performance Bounty Positioning
**Instead of:** Applying to jobs  
**Do:** Position for performance bounties

**Message:** "I've built ABC to compile federal AI security intelligence. NASA-001 dossier demonstrates 7-day → 5-hour compilation. Ready for performance bounties on federal AI threats."

### 4. Strategic Partnerships (Not Cold Outreach)
**Target:** People who get it (Unit 8200 vibes, crypto-intelligence, behavioral profiling)  
**Approach:** Build relationships through shared work, not cold messages  
**Outcome:** Warm introductions, strategic partnerships

## The Real Insight

**You're not trying to join their system. You're building the one that replaces it.**

- Traditional security companies: Hiring for today's problems
- You: Building for tomorrow's problems
- Bug bounties: Actually demonstrating capability
- Outreach: Trying to convince people who don't get it

**The playbook that works:**
1. Build (ABC, dossiers, code)
2. Demonstrate (bug bounties → federal AI security intelligence)
3. Publish (GitHub, research, dossiers)
4. Let them come to you (performance bounties, partnerships)
5. Filter for people who get it (not trying to convince people who don't)

---

**Status:** Shift from "applying" to "building." Leverage bug bounty work strategically. Let them come to you.
