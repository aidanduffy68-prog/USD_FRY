# Nemesis Workflow Slide Improvements

## Current Slide
1. Nemesis Hit
2. Approve Release
3. Broadcast TX

## Issues
- "Nemesis Hit" is unclear to non-technical audiences
- No context about what each step does
- Missing the outcome/result
- No sense of speed/timing
- "Broadcast TX" is too technical
- Doesn't show the value proposition

---

## Improvement Options

### Option 1: Add Context & Outcome
```
1. Nemesis Generates Targeting Package
   → Pre-compiled intelligence on threat actor

2. Approve Release
   → Human-in-the-loop validation

3. Broadcast Cryptographic Receipt
   → On-chain proof (400 bytes)

Result: Verifiable intelligence in <500ms
```

### Option 2: Value-Prop Forward
```
1. Intelligence Compiled
   Nemesis generates targeting package

2. Human Approval
   Analyst validates and approves

3. On-Chain Proof
   Cryptographic receipt broadcast

Outcome: Verifiable intelligence, 4-hour Bitcoin settlement
```

### Option 3: Speed-Focused
```
1. Nemesis Hit (<500ms)
   Targeting package generated

2. Approve Release
   Human validation

3. Broadcast TX
   On-chain cryptographic receipt

Total Time: <1 hour from intelligence to verifiable proof
```

### Option 4: Simple & Clear
```
1. Generate Intelligence
   Nemesis compiles targeting package

2. Approve
   Human-in-the-loop validation

3. Verify On-Chain
   Cryptographic receipt broadcast

Result: Verifiable intelligence ready for action
```

### Option 5: Action-Oriented
```
1. Compile
   Nemesis generates executable intelligence

2. Validate
   Analyst approves targeting package

3. Verify
   Cryptographic receipt on-chain

Impact: Intelligence becomes verifiable object
```

## Visual Improvements

### Add Arrows
- Add arrows between steps to show flow
- Use the same green color scheme

### Add Icons
- Step 1: Target/bullseye icon (already has target)
- Step 2: Checkmark/approval icon
- Step 3: Blockchain/network icon

### Add Timing
- Show "<500ms" for step 1
- Show "~1 hour" for total process
- Emphasize speed advantage

### Add Outcome Box
- Bottom of slide: "Result: Verifiable Intelligence"
- Or: "4-hour Bitcoin settlement"

### Improve Typography
- Make step numbers larger/more prominent
- Use clearer hierarchy
- Add subtitles under each step

## Recommended: Option 2 + Visual Enhancements

**Text:**
```
1. Intelligence Compiled
   Nemesis generates targeting package

2. Human Approval
   Analyst validates and approves

3. On-Chain Proof
   Cryptographic receipt broadcast

Outcome: Verifiable intelligence, 4-hour Bitcoin settlement
```

**Visual:**
- Add arrows between steps
- Add timing: "<500ms" for step 1
- Add outcome box at bottom
- Keep green color scheme
- Add icons for each step

---

## Alternative: Focus on Speed

If the goal is to emphasize speed:

```
1. Compile (<500ms)
   Nemesis generates targeting package

2. Approve
   Human validation

3. Verify
   On-chain cryptographic receipt

Total: <1 hour from intelligence to verifiable proof
vs. Traditional: 7 days + 18-month procurement
```
