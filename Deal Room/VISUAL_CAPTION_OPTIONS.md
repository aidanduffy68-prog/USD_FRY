# Caption Options for Verifiable Scoring Primitives Visual

## Option 1: Direct & Clear
```
Scoring primitives (risk scores, behavioral signatures, threat assessments) become cryptographically verifiable on-chain proofs. 99.98% file size reduction: 2.3 MB → 400 bytes. Trust without exposure.
```

## Option 2: Value-Focused
```
All scoring primitives are cryptographically verifiable. Proprietary intelligence stays off-chain; only minimal proofs go on-chain (99.98% smaller). Intelligence becomes verifiable objects usable everywhere.
```

## Option 3: Problem/Solution
```
Traditional risk scores are black-box. Our scoring primitives are cryptographically verifiable on-chain—99.98% file size reduction (2.3 MB → 400 bytes). Trust without revealing proprietary methods.
```

## Option 4: Short & Punchy
```
Scoring primitives → Cryptographic receipts. 99.98% file size reduction. Verifiable without exposure.
```

## Option 5: Technical
```
Risk scores, behavioral signatures, and threat assessments become minimal cryptographic receipts on-chain. 2.3 MB proprietary intelligence → 400 byte verifiable proof (99.98% reduction).
```

## Option 6: For LinkedIn/Twitter
```
Scoring primitives become verifiable on-chain proofs. 99.98% file size reduction means intelligence becomes portable, trustworthy, and usable everywhere—without exposing proprietary methods.
