# GH Systems Value Propositions
**Three Core Advantages**

## 1. Faster, Crypto-Native Payment Settlement

**Traditional:** 18-month procurement cycles, manual contract negotiations, delayed payments

**GH Systems:** 
- Bitcoin-native settlement
- Automated payouts when intelligence validates
- 4-hour settlement vs. 18-month procurement
- Crypto-native from the ground up

**Impact:** Agencies can post BTC bounties and vendors receive payouts automatically. No waiting for procurement cycles.

## 2. Compilation Ontology Shortens Investigation Time

**Traditional:** 7-day analyst merge, fragmented reports, manual correlation

**GH Systems:**
- ABC runtime compiles intelligence in <500ms
- Unified intelligence from multiple vendors
- Automated correlation and pattern matching
- Pre-compiled actor playbooks

**Impact:** Investigation compression from 7 days to ~5 hours. Analysts get executable targeting packages instead of raw data.

## 3. Verifiable Scoring Primitives

**Traditional:** Black-box risk scores, unverifiable methodology, trust-based systems

**GH Systems:**
- Cryptographic receipts for all intelligence outputs
- Verifiable scoring primitives on-chain
- Proof of authenticity without revealing proprietary methods
- Transparent, auditable intelligence

**Impact:** Intelligence becomes verifiable objects. Scoring primitives are cryptographically provable, enabling trust without revealing proprietary systems.

## Combined Value

**Faster settlement + Shorter investigations + Verifiable primitives = 3X contract value**

- **Payment:** Crypto-native, automated, fast
- **Intelligence:** Compiled, unified, actionable
- **Trust:** Verifiable, provable, transparent
