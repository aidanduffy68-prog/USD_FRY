Hi [Name],

I've built the only operational federal AI threat intelligence platform, demonstrated with DoD and DHS AI systems.

**Unique Value:**
- Only operational platform (production-ready, not research)
- Bitcoin-verified receipts (cryptographic proof, 4-hour settlement)
- Real-time compilation (<500ms, demonstrated)

**DoD-DHS-002 Dossier:**
I've compiled comprehensive threat intelligence on DoD and DHS AI infrastructure:
- Cross-agency vulnerabilities identified
- 24-hour predictive threat forecast
- Cryptographic receipt generated
- Targeting packages ready for action

**Pilot Opportunity:**
I'm offering $50K pilot programs (30-day, 50% upfront) OR performance bounties (no procurement needed).

Watch 5-minute demo: [LINK - add after recording]

Would you be interested in a live demo or pilot program?
