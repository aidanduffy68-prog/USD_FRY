# README Simplification Plan

## Core Problem
The README tries to be everything at once: crypto intelligence platform + federal AI security + future warfare expansion. It's unclear what's current, what's proof-of-concept, and what's a future bet.

## Proposed Structure

### 1. **Clear Core Product Section** (What it IS now)
- **GH Systems**: Crypto intelligence platform
- **ABC**: Compiles vendor feeds into actionable targeting packages
- **Three advantages**: Fast settlement, fast compilation, verifiable proofs
- **Current market**: Crypto intelligence for government agencies

### 2. **Separate Expansion Section** (What it COULD BE)
- **Future bet**: Crypto as infrastructure for warfare (autonomous systems, weapons, etc.)
- **Proof-of-concept**: Federal AI security dossiers (NASA-001, DoD-DHS-002)
- **Positioning**: Intelligence for battlefields where crypto connects cyber and physical domains

### 3. **Simplify Language**
- Remove "demiurgic architecture" → "long-term memory system"
- Remove "compilation ontology" → "intelligence compiler"
- Remove "verifiable scoring primitives" → "cryptographically provable scores"

### 4. **Reduce Sections**
- Merge "Recent Highlights" and "Outcomes" → "Validated Results"
- Simplify "How ABC Works" → remove federal AI mentions (move to expansion)
- Remove redundant explanations

### 5. **Clear Hierarchy**
```
GH Systems (company)
  └─ ABC (product)
      └─ Hades/Echo/Nemesis (components)
          └─ Hypnos Core (architecture)
```

## Specific Changes

### Remove/Relocate Federal AI Mentions:
- Line 99: Move to "Expansion" section
- Lines 128-134: Remove federal AI from "How ABC Works" (keep crypto-focused)
- Line 98: Keep as proof-of-concept example in expansion section

### Simplify Core Message:
- **Current**: "AI-Powered Behavioral Intelligence Infrastructure for Economic Warfare"
- **Simpler**: "Crypto Intelligence Platform for Government Agencies"

### Clear Expansion Positioning:
- Add new section: "Expanding Beyond Crypto"
- Position federal AI as proof-of-concept for future warfare intelligence
- Make it clear this is a bet, not current product

## Recommended New Structure

1. **What GH Systems Is** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Three Core Advantages** (keep as-is, but simplify language)
3. **How It Works** (crypto-focused only)
4. **Validated Results** (merge highlights + outcomes)
5. **Expanding Beyond Crypto** (new section: future bet + proof-of-concept)
6. **Integration & Commercial Models** (keep as-is)
7. **Repository Map** (simplify)
