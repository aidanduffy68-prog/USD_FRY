# Crime Type Focus Strategy
**Broad vs. Focused: What Serves Vendors Best?**

## The Question

Should we keep positioning broad (multiple crime types) or focus on one type we can preemptively stop? What most effectively serves our vendors (research firms doing white-label)?

---

## Current Validation Cases

**OFAC Validation (5 wallets, retrospective):**
- Tornado Cash (sanctions/privacy tool usage)
- Ronin Bridge exploit (hack/exploit)
- Other cases (unspecified)

**Crime Types:**
- Sanctions evasion (Tornado Cash)
- Hacks/exploits (Ronin Bridge)
- Money laundering (potentially)
- Other OFAC violations

---

## Strategic Options

### Option 1: Broad Positioning (Current)
**"Predictive intelligence for all crypto crime types"**

**Pros:**
- Larger addressable market
- More use cases for vendors
- Flexible positioning
- Appeals to different government agencies

**Cons:**
- Less focused value prop
- Harder to demonstrate expertise
- Diluted messaging
- "Jack of all trades" perception

**Vendor Impact:**
- Can sell to multiple agencies (OFAC, FBI, Treasury)
- But harder to justify premium pricing
- Less clear differentiation

---

### Option 2: Focused Positioning - Sanctions Evasion
**"Predictive intelligence for sanctions evasion"**

**Pros:**
- Clear, focused value prop
- Strong validation (Tornado Cash case)
- High government priority (OFAC, Treasury)
- Regional intelligence advantage (Middle East focus)
- Pre-emptive stopping capability (predict off-ramps, freeze exchanges)

**Cons:**
- Narrower market (OFAC/Treasury focused)
- Less appeal to other agencies

**Vendor Impact:**
- Clear value prop: "Predict sanctions evasion before it happens"
- Strong upsell: "Counterintelligence platform for sanctions evasion"
- Specific use case: "Predict Iranian/North Korean off-ramps, freeze exchanges pre-emptively"
- Premium pricing justified: "Pre-emptive sanctions enforcement"

**Pre-emptive Stopping:**
- Predict off-ramp attempts → freeze exchanges before funds move
- Identify coordination networks → disrupt before sanctions evasion
- Regional intelligence → catch sanctions evasion early

---

### Option 3: Focused Positioning - Hacks/Exploits
**"Predictive intelligence for crypto hacks and exploits"**

**Pros:**
- Clear value prop (Ronin Bridge validation)
- High visibility (hacks are public)
- Appeals to multiple agencies (FBI, Treasury, DoD)

**Cons:**
- Harder to pre-emptively stop (hacks happen fast)
- Less regional intelligence advantage
- More reactive than proactive

**Vendor Impact:**
- Value prop: "Predict hack attempts before they occur"
- But harder to demonstrate pre-emptive stopping
- More about detection than prevention

---

### Option 4: Focused Positioning - Money Laundering
**"Predictive intelligence for money laundering"**

**Pros:**
- Broad government interest (FinCEN, Treasury, FBI)
- Clear regulatory framework
- Pre-emptive stopping (freeze funds before laundering)

**Cons:**
- Less validation (not clear if OFAC cases were ML)
- Competitive market (many ML detection tools)
- Less regional intelligence advantage

**Vendor Impact:**
- Value prop: "Predict money laundering before it happens"
- But less differentiation from existing tools
- Harder to justify premium pricing

---

## Recommendation: Focus on Sanctions Evasion

### Why Sanctions Evasion is Best for Vendors

1. **Strong Validation**
   - Tornado Cash case validates capability
   - Regional intelligence advantage (Middle East focus)
   - Clear pre-emptive stopping (predict off-ramps, freeze exchanges)

2. **Clear Value Prop for Vendors**
   - "Predictive counterintelligence platform for sanctions evasion"
   - "Pre-emptively stop sanctions evasion before funds move"
   - "Regional intelligence advantage for Iranian/North Korean networks"

3. **Premium Pricing Justified**
   - Counterintelligence operations (not just forensics)
   - Pre-emptive action (not just detection)
   - Regional intelligence (intelligence government can't get elsewhere)

4. **Pre-emptive Stopping Capability**
   - Predict off-ramp attempts → freeze exchanges before funds move
   - Identify coordination networks → disrupt before sanctions evasion
   - Regional intelligence → catch sanctions evasion early

5. **Vendor Upsell Story**
   - Before: "Forensic reports on sanctions evasion" → $500K
   - After: "Predictive counterintelligence platform that pre-emptively stops sanctions evasion" → $1.5M
   - Clear differentiation: "We predict and stop sanctions evasion before it happens"

## Messaging for Focused Positioning

### For Vendors
**"Predictive counterintelligence platform for sanctions evasion"**
- Predict Iranian/North Korean off-ramps before they happen
- Pre-emptively freeze exchanges before funds move
- Regional intelligence advantage (Middle East focus)
- Counterintelligence operations (not just forensics)

### For Government
**"Pre-emptively stop sanctions evasion before funds move"**
- Predict off-ramp attempts 48-72 hours in advance
- Freeze exchanges before sanctions evasion occurs
- Regional intelligence on Middle East operations
- Counterintelligence platform (Palantir-style)

### Validation Story
**"100% OFAC wallet detection (5 wallets, 3-6 months early)"**
- Tornado Cash sanctions evasion (validated)
- Ronin Bridge exploit (validated)
- Predictive intelligence flagged wallets before public designation
- Pre-emptive stopping capability demonstrated

---

## Implementation

### Keep Broad in Documentation
- Maintain flexibility for different use cases
- Don't limit to one crime type in technical docs

### Focus in Sales/Marketing
- Lead with sanctions evasion for vendors
- Use as primary use case for upsell
- Position as "predictive counterintelligence for sanctions evasion"

### Expand Later
- Once established in sanctions evasion, expand to other crime types
- Use sanctions evasion as proof point for other use cases

## Vendor Benefits of Focused Positioning

1. **Clear Value Prop**
   - "Predictive counterintelligence for sanctions evasion"
   - Easy to explain, easy to sell

2. **Premium Pricing**
   - Counterintelligence operations justify 3x pricing
   - Pre-emptive stopping is high-value capability

3. **Strong Differentiation**
   - "We predict and stop sanctions evasion before it happens"
   - Not just detection, but pre-emptive action

4. **Regional Intelligence Advantage**
   - Middle East focus is unique differentiator
   - Intelligence government can't get elsewhere

5. **Pre-emptive Stopping Story**
   - Predict off-ramps → freeze exchanges → stop sanctions evasion
   - Clear, actionable value prop

---

**Recommendation: Focus on sanctions evasion for vendor positioning, keep broad in technical documentation. This gives vendors a clear, high-value use case to upsell while maintaining flexibility.**
