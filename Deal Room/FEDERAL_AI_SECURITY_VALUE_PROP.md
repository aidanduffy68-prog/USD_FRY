## Revenue Expansion: $100K-$300K/yr Contracts

### Revenue Models

**1. White-Label Licensing**
- **Range:** $100K-$300K/yr
- **Model:** Vendors upsell predictive AI security intelligence
- **Example:** $2M contract → $3.5M with ABC (ROI >600%)
- **Target:** Federal AI security contractors

**2. Revenue Share Overlay**
- **Model:** ~30% of contract uplift
- **Advantage:** No upfront cost for research firms
- **Timeline:** Enhanced contracts by month 6
- **Target:** Existing crypto-intelligence vendors expanding to AI security

**3. Performance Bounties**
- **Model:** Treasury/DoD posts BTC bounty for AI threat intelligence
- **Payout:** 4-hour automated settlement
- **Example:** 10 BTC bounty → ABC submits package → funds release automatically
- **Target:** Government agencies with urgent AI security needs

**4. Strategic Partnerships**
- **Model:** Joint bids combining forensics + AI security intelligence
- **Example:** $5M contracts for multi-agency coordination
- **Target:** Large federal contractors (Chainalysis, TRM, etc.)

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative (Year 1):**
- 2-3 white-label licenses: $200K-$900K/yr
- 1-2 revenue share partnerships: $150K-$300K/yr
- 2-3 performance bounties: $50K-$150K/yr
- **Total:** $400K-$1.35M/yr

**Moderate (Year 2):**
- 5-7 white-label licenses: $500K-$2.1M/yr
- 3-5 revenue share partnerships: $450K-$750K/yr
- 5-7 performance bounties: $125K-$350K/yr
- **Total:** $1.075M-$3.2M/yr

**Aggressive (Year 3):**
- 10-15 white-label licenses: $1M-$4.5M/yr
- 7-10 revenue share partnerships: $1.05M-$1.5M/yr
- 10-15 performance bounties: $250K-$750K/yr
- **Total:** $2.3M-$6.75M/yr

## Integration with Existing Capabilities

**Same Technical Stack:**
- ABC runtime (Hades/Echo/Nemesis)
- AI-powered threat ontology
- Cryptographic receipt system
- Bitcoin settlement layer

**Same Business Model:**
- Performance bounties
- Revenue share partnerships
- White-label licensing
- Strategic partnerships

**Same Value Props:**
- Faster payment settlement (4 hours vs. 18 months)
- Compilation ontology (7 days → 5 hours)
- Verifiable scoring primitives (cryptographic proof)

**Key Insight:** Federal AI security is a natural extension of crypto-intelligence. Both require behavioral profiling, attack surface analysis, and predictive threat modeling.

## Strategic Decision Point

**Question:** Is federal AI security a core vertical or a proof of concept?

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Technical capability validated (NASA-001 dossier)
- ✅ Same technical foundation (no new infrastructure needed)
- ✅ Same business model (proven revenue models)
- ⚠️ Market validation needed (proof of concept only)
- ⚠️ Government procurement cycles (18-month delays)
- ⚠️ Resource allocation (crypto-intelligence vs. AI security)

**Recommendation:** 
Proceed with market validation (Phase 1) to assess demand and revenue potential. If validated, expand to core vertical (Phase 2-3). If not validated, maintain as proof of concept for future expansion.
