## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE (Copy/Paste Ready)

**Subject:** NASA AI Security Intelligence - Operational Platform Ready

Hi [Name],

Following up on VRF#25-11-HXFGC. I've built the only operational federal AI threat intelligence platform, demonstrated with NASA AI systems.

**Unique Value:**
- Only operational platform (not research, production-ready)
- Bitcoin-verified receipts (cryptographic proof, 4-hour settlement)
- Real-time compilation (<500ms, demonstrated)
- Predictive intelligence ("what happens next" vs. "what happened")

**NASA-001 Dossier:**
I've compiled comprehensive threat intelligence on NASA AI infrastructure:
- 3 primary attack surfaces identified
- 48-hour predictive threat forecast
- Cryptographic receipt generated
- Targeting packages ready for action

**Pilot Opportunity:**
I'm offering pilot programs for federal agencies. NASA would be an ideal first partner given the existing relationship and proof of concept.

Would you be interested in a live demo showing the system processing NASA AI threats in real-time?

Best,
Aidan Duffy
GH Systems
