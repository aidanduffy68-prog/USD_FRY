Revenue models (most → least realistic):

1. WHITE-LABEL LICENSING ⭐⭐⭐
$50K-$300K/yr. Research firms brand ABC as their platform, upsell $500K→$1.5M contracts. How: Transform "forensic reports" into "predictive intelligence platform" with counterintelligence capabilities. Deliverables shift from PDFs to executable targeting packages, threat dossiers, predictive forecasts. Government pays 3x for "what happens next" vs "what happened". ROI >600% for them, predictable revenue for us.

2. REVENUE SHARE ⭐⭐
30% of contract uplift, no upfront cost. Only pays if they win. Higher upside but depends on their sales. Good for cash-strapped firms.

FOCUS: White-label licensing. Target research firms $50K-$150K/yr. They brand it as their platform, upsell from reports to predictive intelligence, we get predictable revenue. Win-win.
