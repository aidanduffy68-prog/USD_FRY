## Visual Recommendations

### Keep It Simple
- **One main headline** (max 2 lines)
- **Logo** (top center or top left)
- **That's it** - no subtitles, no boxes, no clutter

### Typography Hierarchy
- **GH SYSTEMS** - Large, bold (brand name)
- **Main headline** - Even larger, bold, neon green
- **Everything else** - Remove or make tiny

### Color
- Keep the neon green on dark background
- Maybe make "GH SYSTEMS" smaller/less prominent
- Make the main headline the star

**Test it:** Cover up everything except the main headline. If it doesn't work alone, simplify more.

The best title slides have ONE message that hits hard.
