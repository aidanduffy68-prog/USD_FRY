# Tomorrow's Action Items - Phase 1 Launch

**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Goal:** Launch Phase 1 credibility building with first visual + post

---

## 1. Design: Government AI Security Timeline Mismatch

### Visual Concept
**Title:** "The Federal AI Security Timing Problem"

**Visual Elements:**
- Left side: AI threat timeline (hours/days)
- Right side: Government procurement timeline (months/years)
- Middle: Gap/arrow showing the mismatch
- Color scheme: Dark theme, red/orange for threats, blue for government

**Key Points to Show:**
- AI threats emerge: 24-48 hours
- Government procurement: 18 months
- Security response: 7+ days (current state)
- The gap where adversaries operate

**Design Style:**
- Clean, professional (not sales-y)
- Technical, not promotional
- Problem-focused, not solution-focused
- Subtle GH Systems branding (if any)

**Use Case:**
- Twitter/X post
- LinkedIn post
- GitHub README (subtle)
- Future presentations

## 2. Write: First Thought Leadership Post

### Post Option A: The Timing Problem

**Platform:** Twitter/X + LinkedIn

**Draft:**
```
Government AI security has a timing problem:

AI threats emerge in hours.
Government procurement takes 18 months.
Current security response: 7+ days.

The gap between threat speed and response speed is where adversaries operate.

Federal AI infrastructure is becoming a target faster than agencies can secure it. The question isn't whether vulnerabilities exist—it's whether they're discovered by defenders or adversaries first.
```

**Visual:** Use the timeline mismatch graphic

**Tone:** Industry observation, not sales pitch

---

### Post Option B: Predictive vs. Historical Intelligence

**Platform:** LinkedIn (longer form)

**Draft:**
```
Federal AI security intelligence is still mostly historical: "Here's what happened."

But AI threats move too fast for that.

Agencies need "Here's what happens next" intelligence, not forensic reports that arrive days late.

The shift from reactive to predictive intelligence is critical for government AI security. Historical forensics are valuable, but they're not enough when threats emerge in hours and procurement cycles take 18 months.

The question isn't whether federal AI infrastructure has vulnerabilities—it's whether intelligence arrives in time to prevent exploitation.
```

**Visual:** Simple comparison graphic (Historical vs. Predictive)

**Tone:** Thought leadership, not capability pitch

---

### Post Option C: The Procurement Paradox

**Platform:** Twitter/X

**Draft:**
```
The federal AI security market is stuck in a procurement paradox:

The faster AI evolves, the slower security contracts move.

AI threats: 24-48 hours
Procurement cycles: 18 months
Security response: 7+ days

This gap is where adversaries operate. Government needs intelligence that moves at the speed of AI, not the speed of bureaucracy.
```

**Visual:** Use the timeline mismatch graphic

**Tone:** Industry observation, strategic insight

---

## 3. Design: Simple Comparison Visual

### Visual Concept
**Title:** "Historical vs. Predictive Intelligence"

**Visual Elements:**
- Left: "Historical Intelligence" (forensic reports, "what happened")
- Right: "Predictive Intelligence" ("what happens next")
- Arrow/flow showing the shift
- Simple, clean design

**Key Points:**
- Historical: Arrives days late, reactive
- Predictive: Arrives in time, proactive
- Government needs the latter for AI threats

**Use Case:**
- LinkedIn post
- Future content
- Subtle positioning

## 4. Prepare: Content Calendar (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1 Posts
- **Day 1 (Tomorrow):** Timing problem post + visual
- **Day 3:** Procurement paradox post
- **Day 5:** Predictive vs. historical intelligence post

### Week 2 Posts
- **Day 1:** Government AI security gaps post
- **Day 3:** Cryptographic proof for government AI post
- **Day 5:** Multi-agency collaboration challenges post

**Note:** Adjust based on engagement and government AI security news

---

## 5. Design: GitHub README Update (Subtle)

### Update README
Add subtle reference to federal AI security without being promotional:

**Section to Add:**
```
## Federal AI Security Intelligence

ABC extends to federal AI infrastructure threat analysis, demonstrating capability to process government AI system vulnerabilities and generate actionable intelligence. See `nemesis/threat_profiles/THREAT_DOSSIER_NASA_001.md` for proof of concept.

**Key Insight:** Federal AI security requires the same behavioral profiling, attack surface analysis, and predictive threat modeling as crypto-intelligence. Both operate at machine speed, not bureaucratic speed.
```

**Tone:** Technical, not sales-y

## Tomorrow's Priority Order

### Must Do (Tomorrow)
1. **Design timeline mismatch visual** (highest priority)
2. **Write first post** (timing problem or procurement paradox)
3. **Post on Twitter/X + LinkedIn** (launch Phase 1)

### Nice to Have (This Week)
4. Design predictive vs. historical visual
5. Update GitHub README (subtle)
6. Prepare Week 1 content calendar

---

## Design Specs for Timeline Visual

### Dimensions
- **Twitter/X:** 1200x675px (or 1200x628px)
- **LinkedIn:** 1200x627px
- **GitHub:** Flexible (can be larger)

### Color Scheme
- **Background:** Dark (#0a0a0a or similar)
- **Threat timeline:** Red/orange gradient (#ff4444 → #ff8800)
- **Government timeline:** Blue gradient (#0066cc → #0099ff)
- **Gap/mismatch:** Yellow/orange warning (#ffaa00)
- **Text:** White/light gray (#ffffff, #cccccc)

### Typography
- **Title:** Bold, sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica, or similar)
- **Body:** Regular, readable (same font family)
- **Numbers:** Bold, larger (emphasize the mismatch)

### Layout
- **Left:** AI threat timeline (24-48 hours, red/orange)
- **Right:** Government procurement (18 months, blue)
- **Middle:** Gap arrow/visual (yellow/orange)
- **Bottom:** Key insight text (white/light gray)

## Post Templates (Ready to Use)

### Template 1: Timing Problem
```
Government AI security has a timing problem:

AI threats: 24-48 hours
Procurement: 18 months
Current response: 7+ days

The gap is where adversaries operate.

[Visual: Timeline mismatch graphic]
```

### Template 2: Procurement Paradox
```
The federal AI security market is stuck in a procurement paradox:

The faster AI evolves, the slower security contracts move.

This gap is where adversaries operate.

[Visual: Timeline mismatch graphic]
```

### Template 3: Predictive Intelligence
```
Federal AI security needs "what happens next" intelligence, not forensic reports that arrive days late.

The shift from reactive to predictive is critical when threats emerge in hours.

[Visual: Historical vs. Predictive comparison]
```
