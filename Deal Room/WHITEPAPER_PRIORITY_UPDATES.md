# Whitepaper Priority Updates
**What Actually Matters vs. What Can Wait**

## The Bullish Take

The whitepaper foundation is solid. Core architecture, Bitcoin settlement, validated outcomes, FY2026 window — all strong. Existing readers who like the model can read between the lines.

## Priority 1: Counterintelligence Positioning ⚠️

**What's Missing:**
- Counterintelligence platform positioning (not just compiler)
- Palantir playbook parallel
- Multi-source intelligence fusion emphasis
- Hidden relationship discovery focus

**Why It Matters:**
- This is the main strategic shift
- Positions ABC as counterintelligence platform (not just forensic tool)
- Palantir parallel is powerful positioning for government buyers
- Differentiates from forensic vendors

**Update Needed:** Add counterintelligence positioning section, emphasize multi-source fusion and hidden relationship discovery.

**Status:** ⚠️ **Main gap** — but existing readers can infer from multi-source fusion messaging.

## Priority 2: Hypnos Core (If Space Allows)

**What's Missing:**
- Hypnos Core as Layer 3 (Memory)
- Long-term memory and pattern consolidation
- Three-layer architecture positioning

**Why It Matters:**
- Hypnos is now core component
- Long-term memory is differentiator
- Three-layer architecture is cleaner positioning

**Update Needed:** Add Hypnos section, update architecture to three-layer model.

**Status:** ⚠️ **Nice to have** — but core Hades/Echo/Nemesis flow still works.

## Can Wait: Threat Dossiers & Regional Intelligence

**Threat Dossiers:**
- Enhanced with counterintelligence/regional sections
- Haven't posted about yet
- Can update later when ready to publicize

**Regional Intelligence:**
- Middle East focus, regional exchanges
- Haven't posted about yet
- Can update later when ready to publicize

**Status:** ✅ **Can wait** — Update when ready to publicize these capabilities.

## The Bullish Assessment

**Whitepaper Status: 85% there**

**What Works:**
- Core architecture (Hades/Echo/Nemesis) ✅
- Bitcoin settlement layer ✅
- Validated outcomes ✅
- FY2026 competitive window ✅
- Integration scenarios ✅

**What's Missing (But Not Critical):**
- Counterintelligence positioning (main gap, but can be inferred)
- Hypnos Core (nice to have, but core flow still works)
- Enhanced dossiers (can wait until publicized)
- Regional intelligence (can wait until publicized)

**Recommendation:**
- If updating: Add counterintelligence positioning section
- If not updating: Existing readers who like the model will get it
- Threat dossiers and regional intelligence can wait until you're ready to publicize

**Bottom Line:** The whitepaper is solid. Counterintelligence positioning is the main gap, but it's not breaking. Existing readers who understand multi-source fusion and hidden relationship discovery will see the counterintelligence angle.

*The model is strong. The whitepaper communicates it. The gaps are refinements, not fundamentals.*
