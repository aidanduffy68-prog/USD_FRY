## Suggested Additions

### 1. GH Systems Branding
**Location:** Top-right corner or bottom-right
**Text:** "GH Systems" or small logo
**Why:** Brand recognition, especially for social posts

### 2. Small Validation Tagline
**Location:** Below "3X Contract Value" or as subtitle
**Text:** "Validated: 100% OFAC detection, 3-6 months early"
**Why:** Adds credibility without cluttering

### 3. Call to Action (Subtle)
**Location:** Bottom, small text
**Text:** "Unify your intelligence" or "Learn more: [link]"
**Why:** Drives engagement (optional, might be too much)

### 4. "You bring the transaction exhaust" Tagline
**Location:** Small text above or below main elements
**Text:** "You bring the transaction exhaust. We'll do the rest."
**Why:** Matches your LinkedIn post, reinforces message

### 5. Small "Intelligence is Fragmented" Title
**Location:** Top, above "$500k to $1.5M"
**Text:** "Intelligence is Fragmented:"
**Why:** Sets context, matches slide deck structure

## Recommended Minimal Additions

**Best approach:** Keep it clean, but add:

1. **GH Systems logo/branding** (top-right corner, small)
   - Essential for social media recognition
   - Doesn't clutter the design

2. **"Intelligence is Fragmented:" title** (top, above "$500k to $1.5M")
   - Provides context
   - Matches your slide deck

**Skip:**
- Validation text (save for caption/post)
- Call to action (save for post)
- "Transaction exhaust" tagline (save for post)

---

## Alternative: Keep Graphic Clean, Add in Post

**Best practice:** Keep the graphic minimal and clean. Add context in the social post caption:
- "Intelligence is Fragmented" → in post
- "You bring the transaction exhaust" → in post
- Validation → in post
- Call to action → in post

The graphic should tell the story visually. The post provides the context.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Add to graphic:**
- Small GH Systems logo (top-right, subtle)
- "Intelligence is Fragmented:" title (top, above "$500k to $1.5M")

**Keep in post:**
- "You bring the transaction exhaust and we'll do the rest"
- Validation details
- Call to action

This keeps the graphic clean and powerful while the post provides context.
