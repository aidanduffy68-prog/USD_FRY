# ACCELERATE NOW — 14-Day Revenue Sprint

**Goal:** First dollar in 7 days, first contract in 14 days  
**Strategy:** Parallel execution, lower barriers, remove friction

---

## THE ACCELERATION PRINCIPLES

### 1. Don't Wait — Parallel Everything
- Send all emails TODAY (NASA, DoD, DHS, Treasury)
- Don't wait for responses before moving to next
- Multiple tracks = multiple chances

### 2. Lower the Barrier
- Offer $50K pilot (not $500K) — easier to approve
- Performance bounties ($10K-$50K) — no procurement needed
- Recorded demo — they watch on their time

### 3. Remove Friction
- Pre-written everything (copy/paste ready)
- One-click demo video (no scheduling needed)
- Async proposals (send, don't wait for meeting)

### 4. Create Urgency
- "FY2026 contract decisions closing in 30 days"
- "Limited pilot slots available"
- "First agency gets 30% discount"

---

## DAY 1-3: MASS OUTREACH (Parallel Tracks)

### Morning (2 hours): Send All Emails

**Track 1: NASA** (Existing relationship)
- Email: Use `NASA_FOLLOWUP_TEMPLATE.md` Option 3
- Attach: NASA-001 dossier
- Offer: $50K pilot OR recorded demo
- CTA: "15-min call this week OR watch 5-min demo video"

**Track 2: DoD DIU** (New)
- Email: Similar to NASA, reference DoD-DHS-002 dossier
- Attach: DoD-DHS-002 dossier
- Offer: $50K pilot OR recorded demo
- CTA: "15-min call this week OR watch 5-min demo video"

**Track 3: DHS S&T** (New)
- Email: Similar to NASA, reference DoD-DHS-002 dossier
- Attach: DoD-DHS-002 dossier
- Offer: $50K pilot OR recorded demo
- CTA: "15-min call this week OR watch 5-min demo video"

**Track 4: Treasury** (New)
- Email: Focus on crypto intelligence (not AI security)
- Reference: Bitcoin settlement advantage
- Offer: Performance bounty ($10K-$50K) OR $50K pilot
- CTA: "No procurement needed for bounties"

**Track 5: Performance Bounties** (Immediate revenue)
- Research: Active government bounties (NASA, DoD, DHS)
- Submit: Threat intelligence packages
- Generate: Bitcoin receipts
- Collect: BTC payouts (4-hour settlement)

**All emails sent by end of Day 1**

---

### Afternoon (2 hours): Record Demo Video

**What to record:**
1. 2 min: Show NASA-001 dossier (proof)
2. 3 min: Run live compilation (`nemesis/demo_nasa_compilation.py`)
3. 2 min: Show Bitcoin receipt generation
4. 1 min: Close with pilot offer

**Total: 8-minute demo video**

**Where to host:**
- YouTube (unlisted)
- Loom (better for business)
- Vimeo (professional)

**Include in all emails:**
- "Watch 5-minute demo: [link]"
- "No scheduling needed — watch on your time"

---

## DAY 4-7: RESPONSE & MOMENTUM

### Track Responses

**If they want live demo:**
- Schedule same day or next day (don't wait)
- Execute demo (15 minutes)
- Send proposal within 24 hours

**If they want recorded demo:**
- Send link immediately
- Follow up in 48 hours: "Did you get a chance to watch?"

**If they want proposal:**
- Send immediately (use `PILOT_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Customize for $50K pilot (lower barrier)
- Include Bitcoin settlement option

**If no response:**
- Follow up Day 5: "Quick check-in"
- Follow up Day 7: "Last chance for FY2026 pilot slots"

---

### Performance Bounties (Parallel Revenue)

**While waiting for contracts, submit bounties:**

**Day 4-7:**
- [ ] Research active bounties (NASA, DoD, DHS)
- [ ] Submit 3-5 intelligence packages
- [ ] Generate Bitcoin receipts
- [ ] Track submissions

**Target:** $10K-$50K per bounty  
**Timeline:** 4-hour settlement (vs. 18-month procurement)

**This is immediate revenue while contracts negotiate**

---

## DAY 8-14: CLOSE FIRST DEAL

### Week 2 Focus: Close Something

**Priority 1: Performance Bounty** (Fastest)
- If bounty submitted Day 4-7, payout by Day 10-14
- **First dollar in 7-14 days**

**Priority 2: $50K Pilot** (Easier than $500K)
- Lower barrier = faster approval
- 30-day pilot (not 60-day)
- 50% upfront payment

**Priority 3: $500K Contract** (If they're ready)
- Full pilot proposal
- 30-60 day timeline
- Negotiate terms

---

## ACCELERATION TACTICS

### 1. Recorded Demo (Remove Scheduling Friction)

**Benefits:**
- They watch on their time (no scheduling)
- You can send to 10 people at once
- Can be shared internally
- Shows you're serious (production-ready)

**How to create:**
```bash
# Record screen while running demo
cd nemesis
python demo_nasa_compilation.py
# Screen record the output
```

**Include in email:**
"Watch 5-minute demo: [link] (no scheduling needed)"

---

### 2. Lower Barrier Pilots ($50K vs $500K)

**Why $50K works:**
- Easier to approve (lower risk)
- Faster procurement (smaller contracts)
- Can close in 7-14 days (vs. 30-60 days)
- Multiple pilots = same revenue ($50K × 10 = $500K)

**Pilot structure:**
- $50K: 30-day pilot
- 50% upfront ($25K)
- 50% on completion ($25K)
- Bitcoin settlement available

**Upsell later:**
- "Pilot successful? Let's do $500K full program"

---

### 3. Performance Bounties (Zero Procurement)

**Why bounties accelerate:**
- No procurement cycle (immediate payment)
- No contract negotiation
- Bitcoin settlement (4-hour vs. 18-month)
- Proof of capability (builds credibility)

**How to find:**
- Research agency bounty programs
- Submit intelligence packages
- Generate Bitcoin receipts
- Collect payouts

**Target:** $10K-$50K per bounty  
**Timeline:** 4-hour settlement

---

### 4. Mass Outreach (Don't Wait)

**Send all emails Day 1:**
- NASA (existing relationship)
- DoD DIU (new)
- DHS S&T (new)
- Treasury (new)
- Any other agencies

**Why parallel works:**
- Multiple chances = higher probability
- Don't wait for one to respond
- Builds momentum (multiple conversations)

**Follow-up schedule:**
- Day 3: "Quick check-in"
- Day 5: "Did you get a chance to review?"
- Day 7: "Last chance for FY2026 pilot slots"

### Aggressive (If Everything Works)
- **Week 1:** 5 bounties submitted ($50K-$250K potential)
- **Week 2:** 2 bounties paid ($20K-$100K) + 1 pilot signed ($25K upfront)
- **Total:** $45K-$125K in 14 days

### Stretch (Best Case)
- **Week 1:** 10 bounties submitted ($100K-$500K potential)
- **Week 2:** 3 bounties paid ($30K-$150K) + 2 pilots signed ($50K upfront)
- **Total:** $80K-$200K in 14 days
