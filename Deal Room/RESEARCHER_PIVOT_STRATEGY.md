# GH Systems — Researcher-First Intelligence Platform
**Refined Go-to-Market Strategy**

## The Pivot

**From:** Competing with/partnering with large vendors (TRM, Chainalysis)  
**To:** Enabling elite crypto research firms (Unit 8200-connected, operating in US) to win government contracts

## Target Market

### Who We're Targeting
- **Elite crypto research firms** with Unit 8200/Israeli intelligence backgrounds
- **Operating in the US market** (e.g., Chaos Labs, Chainalysis, similar firms)
- **Have deep technical capability** but struggle to package intelligence for government consumption
- **Want to monetize research** through government contracts but lack the intelligence processing layer

### Why This Works
1. **They have the research** — Deep technical knowledge, on-chain analysis, threat intelligence
2. **They lack the packaging** — Don't have the infrastructure to turn research into government-ready intelligence packages
3. **Government wants their insights** — But needs it in executable format (targeting packages, not just reports)
4. **ABC fills the gap** — Transforms raw research into government-grade intelligence that wins contracts

## Value Proposition

### For Research Firms
**"Turn your research into government contracts"**

- **Input:** Raw research findings, on-chain analysis, threat intelligence
- **ABC Processing:** Compiles into executable targeting packages, behavioral playbooks, predictive intelligence
- **Output:** Government-ready intelligence packages that win contracts

### The Broken Loop (Current State)
```
Researcher finds threat → writes report → submits to government → 
government analyst merges with other sources → 7-day delay → 
"Here's what happened" (historical, not actionable)
```

### The GH Systems Loop
```
Researcher finds threat → feeds into ABC → ABC compiles in <500ms → 
executable targeting package → government acts in 48h → 
researcher gets paid via BTC bounty or contract
```

## Business Model

### Revenue Share Model (Primary)
- **No upfront cost** for research firms
- **30% revenue share** on government contracts won using ABC-processed intelligence
- **Bitcoin settlement** — Automated payouts when intelligence validates
- **Low friction** — Researchers just feed their findings into ABC

### White-Label License (Secondary)
- **$50K–$150K/yr** for firms wanting to brand ABC as their own
- **Upsell opportunity** — Transform $500K research contracts into $1.5M intelligence contracts
- **ROI >600%** — Small license fee enables massive contract expansion

### Performance Bounty System
- **Government posts BTC bounties** for specific intelligence needs
- **Researchers submit findings** → ABC processes → validated packages
- **Automatic payout** within 4 hours (vs. 18-month procurement cycle)
- **Fast path to monetization** for independent researchers

## Competitive Advantage

### Why Research Firms Choose ABC

1. **No Infrastructure Build** — They don't need to build Hades/Echo/Nemesis themselves
2. **Government-Grade Output** — ABC produces intelligence packages that meet government standards
3. **Predictive Intelligence** — Not just "what happened" but "what happens next"
4. **Multi-Source Compilation** — ABC can merge their research with other feeds (Chainalysis, TRM, etc.)
5. **Fast Monetization** — BTC bounty system provides immediate revenue path
6. **Contract Differentiation** — Their research becomes "predictive intelligence" not just "forensics"

### Why Not Just Use TRM/Chainalysis?

- **TRM/Chainalysis are too big** — They're not going to be disrupted, they're the infrastructure
- **Research firms have unique insights** — But can't package them for government consumption
- **ABC is the packaging layer** — Makes research firms competitive with big vendors
- **Win-win** — Research firms win contracts, government gets better intelligence

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Identify Target Firms
- **Unit 8200-connected crypto firms** operating in US
- **Research firms** already doing government work but struggling to scale
- **Independent researchers** with government connections

### Phase 2: Pilot Program
- **Free ABC access** for 3–6 months
- **Help them win 1–2 contracts** using ABC-processed intelligence
- **Case studies** showing contract value increase (e.g., $500K → $1.5M)

### Phase 3: Scale
- **Revenue share model** for ongoing contracts
- **BTC bounty system** for ad-hoc intelligence needs
- **Network effects** — More researchers = better intelligence = more government contracts

## Messaging

### For Research Firms
**"Your research is valuable. ABC makes it government-ready."**

- You have the technical depth
- You have the threat intelligence
- You just need the packaging layer
- ABC turns your research into contracts

### For Government
**"Better intelligence from the researchers you already trust."**

- Same researchers you know
- Same technical expertise
- But now in executable format
- Predictive, not just historical

## Key Differentiators

1. **Researcher-First** — Built for research firms, not big vendors
2. **No Infrastructure Required** — Just feed research into ABC
3. **Fast Monetization** — BTC bounty system provides immediate revenue
4. **Government-Grade Output** — Intelligence packages that win contracts
5. **Predictive Intelligence** — "What happens next" not just "what happened"

## Success Metrics

- **Number of research firms** using ABC
- **Government contracts won** using ABC-processed intelligence
- **Contract value increase** (e.g., $500K → $1.5M average)
- **BTC bounty payouts** to researchers
- **Time to contract** (from research to government contract)
