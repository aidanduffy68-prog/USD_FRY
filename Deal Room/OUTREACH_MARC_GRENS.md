**Subject:** Intelligence Platform for Crypto Threat Intelligence

Hey Marc,

Hope you're doing well.

I've been building something that might be interesting for Digital Mint: a counterintelligence platform that fuses multiple intelligence sources (on-chain data, exchange feeds, research reports) to discover hidden relationships and predict adversary actions. Helps research firms turn their crypto intelligence into government contracts.

The platform includes:
- **Hades**: Behavioral profiling engine
- **Echo**: Coordination detection engine  
- **Nemesis**: Pre-emptive targeting engine

It's designed for research firms to white-label and upsell their intelligence, turning fragmented forensic and research reports into unified predictive intelligence that enables 3x contract value ($500K to $1.5M+). The system has validated 100% OFAC wallet detection (5 wallets, 3-6 months before public designation) including Tornado Cash and Ronin Bridge cases.

Here's all my work: https://github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/ABC

I've also attached our revised pitch deck. Would love to get your thoughts if you have time.

Best,

Hey Marc,

Hope you're well. I've been building a counterintelligence platform for crypto threat intelligence. It helps research firms turn their intelligence into government contracts through white-label licensing.

Validated 100% OFAC detection (Tornado Cash, Ronin Bridge cases, 3-6 months early). Here's all my work: https://github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/ABC

Would love your thoughts if you have time.
