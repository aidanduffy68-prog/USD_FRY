# ABC Three-Layer Architecture
**Maintaining the Magic Number: 3 Core Layers + Meta-Layer**

## Overview

ABC maintains a clean three-layer architecture with Hypnos operating as a meta-layer that enhances all three core layers. This structure preserves the "magic number" of 3 while adding long-term memory capabilities.

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Detection (Individual & Network)
**Purpose:** Identify and profile threat actors and their coordination networks

**Components:**
- **Hades** — Individual behavioral profiling
  - Behavioral signature generation
  - Risk scoring
  - Off-ramp prediction
  - Pattern recognition

- **Echo** — Network coordination detection
  - Coordination ring identification
  - Facilitator network mapping
  - Cross-chain tracking
  - Behavioral clustering

**Output:** Actor profiles and coordination networks

---

### Layer 2: Analysis (Targeting & Prediction)
**Purpose:** Generate actionable intelligence and predictions

**Components:**
- **Nemesis** — Pre-emptive targeting engine
  - Executable targeting packages
  - Predictive threat modeling
  - Countermeasure generation
  - Timing window prediction

**Output:** Targeting packages with confidence scores and recommended actions

---

### Layer 3: Memory (Long-Term Intelligence)
**Purpose:** Maintain historical intelligence and consolidate patterns over time

**Components:**
- **Hypnos** — Long-term memory & pattern consolidation
  - Pattern consolidation across time periods
  - Dormant threat tracking
  - Historical pattern matching
  - Temporal intelligence fusion
  - Pattern evolution analysis

**Output:** Consolidated patterns, dormant threat assessments, historical context

**Meta-Layer Operation:**
Hypnos operates as a meta-layer that enhances all three core layers:
- **Enhances Hades:** Provides historical behavioral patterns for signature matching
- **Enhances Echo:** Maintains historical coordination networks for pattern recognition
- **Enhances Nemesis:** Informs predictions with historical pattern matching

## Why Three Layers?

1. **Cognitive Load** — Three layers are easier to understand and communicate
2. **Separation of Concerns** — Each layer has a distinct purpose
3. **Scalability** — Clean architecture enables independent scaling
4. **Magic Number** — Three is the optimal number for hierarchical structures

---

## Hypnos as Meta-Layer

Hypnos doesn't break the three-layer structure because it operates **across** all three layers rather than being a fourth layer. It's a meta-layer that:

- **Enhances Layer 1 (Detection):** Provides historical patterns for Hades/Echo to match against
- **Enhances Layer 2 (Analysis):** Informs Nemesis predictions with historical context
- **Operates as Layer 3 (Memory):** Maintains long-term intelligence independently

This maintains the three-layer architecture while adding long-term memory capabilities.

## Integration Points

### Hypnos → Hades
- Historical behavioral signatures for pattern matching
- Dormant threat profiles for re-emergence detection
- Pattern evolution tracking for behavioral analysis

### Hypnos → Echo
- Historical coordination networks for pattern recognition
- Network evolution tracking for coordination analysis
- Long-term facilitator network mapping

### Hypnos → Nemesis
- Historical pattern matching for prediction accuracy
- Dormant threat re-emergence probability for targeting
- Temporal intelligence fusion for threat forecasting

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation** — Three distinct layers with clear responsibilities
2. **Meta-Enhancement** — Hypnos enhances all layers without breaking structure
3. **Scalability** — Each layer can scale independently
4. **Maintainability** — Clear architecture makes system easier to maintain
5. **Communication** — Three layers are easier to explain to stakeholders
