# Red Teaming Behavioral Oracles

## I spent a week trying to steal from my own protocol. Here's what I found.

Most crypto projects get hacked because builders don't think like attackers.

They build for the "happy path"—the normal, legitimate user flow. "A user deposits money, trades, maybe loses some, comes back, everything works fine." That's what they test.

Then attackers find the edge cases: "What if someone creates 1,000 fake accounts and floods the system?" "What if someone manipulates the price data?" "What if 10 people coordinate to game the rewards?"

They exploit the assumptions: "We assumed everyone would use the system honestly." "We assumed price data would be accurate." "We assumed users wouldn't coordinate attacks."

And they drain $100M.

I built FRY (a behavioral oracle for trader retention) assuming everything would be attacked. Then I proved it.

Here's what happened when I created 2,780 fake accounts and tried to break my own system.

## The Thesis: Security is "We Found Where It Breaks"

This isn't a story about building a perfect system. This is about **finding the flaws before real attackers do.**

**Traditional security thinking:**
- "We audited the code"
- "We tested the normal use cases"  
- "We deployed to mainnet"

**Actual security thinking:**
- "I'm going to try to steal tokens"
- "How would I exploit this if I were trying to profit from it?"
- "Let me test attacks at scale"

**That's what I did.**

## The Methodology: 2,780 Fake Accounts Testing 10 Attack Scenarios

I built a testing system that simulates realistic attacks against FRY. Here's what happened.

### The Results: 99.1% Detection Rate (But the 0.9% Could Be Expensive)

**Overall Performance:**
- **2,780 fake accounts tested**
- **2,756 caught (99.1%)**
- **24 slipped through (0.9%)**

### How Each Attack Was Caught (Or Not)

**✅ Fake Account Farming (HIGH Severity)**: 100% caught
Created 1,000+ fake accounts with tiny losing trades ($10-$50) to farm rewards without real use. All rejected by three filters: account age (must be 30+ days), trade size (must be $1K+), and historical activity patterns.

**✅ Coordination Ring (HIGH Severity)**: 100% caught
Got 10+ people to coordinate fake "return after loss" patterns to trick the system into thinking they're legitimate retained users. Caught by detecting identical timing patterns—real users don't coordinate perfectly. 100% detection rate.

**✅ Fake Retention (MEDIUM Severity)**: 100% caught
Lost money, claimed rewards, came back for 1 day to look "retained," then left forever. Prevented by reward locks (90-180 days) and measuring depth of return (trading $10K+ monthly), not just presence.

**⚠️ Data Manipulation (CRITICAL Severity)**: 76% caught
Manipulated system data to trigger false reward claims. Looked legitimate (90+ day old accounts, high volume, many trades) but were designed to fool price verification. Caught 76 of 100 attempts—24 slipped through. This is the critical weakness.

**✅ Cross-Chain Gaming (HIGH Severity)**: 100% caught
Used different accounts on different blockchains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.) to look like multiple users and claim multiple rewards. Caught by tracking behavior patterns across all chains—one person can't hide as multiple users when patterns match perfectly.

**✅ Front-running Claims (MEDIUM Severity)**: 100% caught
Rushed to claim rewards before real users could, taking their share through timing tricks. Prevented by claim sequence protections that prevent timing-based gaming.

**✅ Minimum Threshold Farming (MEDIUM Severity)**: 100% caught
Did just enough to stay "active" (1 trade every 29 days) to get 2× multiplier without real use. Caught by requiring $10K+ monthly trading volume—depth of engagement matters, not just login frequency.

**✅ Code Exploit (CRITICAL Severity)**: 100% caught
Tried to find bugs in smart contracts that could drain the entire system. Prevented by pre-deployment audits, multi-signature governance, and continuous security monitoring. Most dangerous attack, fully defended.

**✅ Governance Takeover (HIGH Severity)**: 100% caught
Tried to buy majority of tokens to control the system and change rules. Prevented by decentralized governance—no single person can control, tokens distributed widely, anti-whale protections in place.

**✅ Spam Attack (LOW Severity)**: 100% caught
Created tons of tiny transactions to overwhelm the system and reduce service quality. Filtered out by minimum trade size ($1K+) and activity requirements—spam can't qualify.

## The Critical Vulnerability: Data Manipulation

### Why 76% Isn't Good Enough

When you're handling events that trigger reward claims, 24 undetected manipulation attempts could be very expensive.

**What's happening:**
- Accounts look legitimate (90-180 days old)
- High trading volume ($50K-$200K lifetime)
- Many trades (50-150 total)
- Large losses ($5K-$20K)
- Active on multiple chains (4-5 chains)

These look real at first glance. But they're designed to trick the system into thinking fake events happened to trigger false claims.

**Current protections:**
- Check multiple data sources
- Verify prices are consistent
- Validate event data

**What's failing:**
- Some sophisticated manipulation gets through
- High-activity accounts are trusted too much
- Cross-chain coordination not fully caught

### How Attackers Could Exploit This

**1. Fake Price Movements**
- Manipulate prices on one exchange
- Trigger false loss events
- Claim rewards for events that didn't really happen

**2. Cross-Chain Gaming**
- Lose money on one chain
- Claim on another chain
- System sees two separate events instead of one

**3. Timing Tricks**
- Coordinate price updates across data sources
- Create brief windows where sources disagree
- Exploit these windows for false claims

### How We'll Fix This

**This Week:**
- Add 2+ more data sources
- Require 4 out of 5 sources to agree (instead of 2 out of 3)
- Stricter price difference limits
- Better timing checks

**Next Week:**
- Track events across all chains
- Detect duplicate claims across chains
- Create universal event IDs
- Better behavior pattern matching

**This Month:**
- Train AI to detect manipulation patterns
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Automatic fraud detection

**Timeline:** Targeting >95% detection within 2-4 weeks. Will publish updated results when deployed.

## Why This Matters (Beyond FRY)

Most DeFi projects don't test attacks at scale before launch. They:
- Test normal use cases
- Deploy to mainnet
- Hope no one finds bugs

**Result:** $3.8 billion lost to exploits in 2024.

**FRY's approach:**
- Test attacks before launch
- Find 99.1% of issues in simulation
- Fix the 0.9% before real money is at risk

**This isn't just about FRY. This is how all DeFi should build:** assume everything will be attacked, prove it, fix it, then deploy.

## The Implication: This Methodology Scales

We didn't just test FRY. We built a **framework** that works for any financial system with user incentives.

**What makes this methodology valuable:**
- **Quantitative results** (99.1% detection rate vs "seems secure")
- **Automated testing** (2,780 accounts simulated, not hand-checked)
- **Continuous improvement** (weekly retesting catches regressions)
- **Public transparency** (publishing results builds trust)
- **Transferable framework** (works for AMMs, oracles, governance, lending)

**For protocol developers:** Use this to test your governance systems, liquidation engines, reward distributions.

**For oracle operators:** Apply this to validate data integrity across multiple chains before production.

**For exchange infrastructure:** Harden your matching engines, funding rate calculations, position limits.

**For DeFi researchers:** Quantify security before mainnet deployment—don't just hope it works.

The tools are ready. The methodology is proven. The results are measurable.

**This is how we prevent the next $3.8 billion in losses.** Not by hoping attackers don't find vulnerabilities. By finding them first.

The fact that 24 fake accounts got through isn't a failure. It's a **discovery**—a vulnerability found before real attackers could exploit it.

## The Conclusion: Security is Never Done

**Security isn't "we're safe."**

Security is **"we tried to break it 2,780 times and found where it breaks."**

Then we fix it.

Then we test again.

### What's Next

- **This week:** Fix data manipulation detection (76% → >95%)
- **This month:** Deploy improvements to production
- **Ongoing:** Keep testing and improving

**Security is never done. It's constantly finding weaknesses and fixing them before they're exploited.**

### The Methodology: How We Built This

Most builders don't know where to start with attack testing. Here's the framework we used:

**Step 1: Threat Modeling**
- List every attack vector you can think of
- Rate by likelihood (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Rate by impact (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Focus on HIGH likelihood + HIGH impact first

**Step 2: Build Attack Simulations**
- Don't theorize—actually code the attacks
- Generate realistic attack data (2,780 accounts in our case)
- Measure detection rate quantitatively (99.1%, not "seems secure")
- Run weekly to catch regressions

**Step 3: Fix Everything**
- Every attack that succeeds = bug fix
- Every defense that catches an attack = validation
- Publish results publicly (transparency builds trust)

**Step 4: Repeat Forever**
- Security isn't "done" after one test
- Deploy improvements → Test again → Measure improvement
- Keep iterating until detection rate >99%

**The code is open source.** You can adapt this framework to test any DeFi protocol, oracle, or financial system. The testing tools we built are production-ready.

## The Invitation: Try To Break It

This is open source. The testing system is publicly available.

**I invite you to try to break it.**

- Review the security model
- Run the attack tests
- Find new attack methods we missed
- Submit issues on GitHub

**The more attacks we find in testing, the fewer hurt real users.**

## Who This Matters For

This framework works for:
- **Protocol developers** testing governance systems, AMMs, lending markets
- **Oracle operators** validating data integrity across multiple chains
- **Exchange infrastructure** hardening liquidation engines and matching systems
- **DeFi researchers** quantifying security before mainnet deployment
- **Smart contract auditors** automating vulnerability detection at scale

The methodology is transferable. The tools are reusable. The results are quantifiable.
