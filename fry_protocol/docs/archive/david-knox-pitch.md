# David Knott (Hyperliquid) Pitch - Reverse Oracle

## LinkedIn Note

Hey David,

Went full degen on the retention oracle idea since last time‚Äîbuilt the whole thing out.

Reverse oracles: instead of predicting BTC/USD, they predict "will this trader come back after getting rekt?" 

Turns out you can automate the whole retention game with AMM mechanics. October 10 would've been a perfect test case (82% churn ‚Üí 50% with FRY allocation).

Part 2 just dropped: https://mirror.xyz/0xf551aF8d5373B042DBB9F0933C59213B534174e4/PybDRg7Y6OLEuQ8SApcxU1R_Xg0gPmE6ySX4YmBjLR8

Curious what you think. HLP integration could be wild.

Best,
Aidan

P.S. If you didn't read the last one, this one's got memes. Much better. üçü

## Why This Works for David Knott (Hyperliquid)

**The problem:**
- October 10 exposed Hyperliquid's retention vulnerability
- 82% churn rate = massive LTV loss
- No existing infrastructure to measure or prevent this

**The pitch:**
- Reverse oracle measures trader behavior (not prices)
- Predicts which traders will return post-liquidation
- Automates retention via FRY token allocation
- Could cut churn in half (82% ‚Üí 50%)

**The hook:**
- You're solving Hyperliquid's biggest problem (retention)
- Built specifically for Oct 10 use case
- Shows you understand their pain point deeply
- Direct, results-focused (50% churn reduction)

**Timing:**
- Oct 10 is still fresh
- Hyperliquid is likely thinking about retention solutions
- You have a working spec, not just ideas

**Follow-up:**
If he responds positively, offer to:
- Run analysis on actual Oct 10 liquidation data
- Show how FRY would have performed
- Discuss integration with HLP vaults
