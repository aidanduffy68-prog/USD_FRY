We built the first reverse oracle. 🔮

Traditional oracles measure asset prices (BTC/USD, ETH/USD).

Reverse oracles measure trader behavior (retention, churn, LTV).

The question nobody's asking: "Will this trader come back after liquidation?"

82% quit forever. We're changing that.

## Alternative: More Technical

Introducing reverse oracles—the missing oracle layer. 🪞

Every oracle in crypto measures markets:
• Chainlink → BTC/USD
• Pyth → ETH/USD  
• Stork → Market data

Nobody measures users:
• Will this trader return?
• What's their lifetime value?
• When will they churn?

We built the first retention oracle + AMM to automate trader retention.

Live on Arbitrum. Open source. Full spec on GitHub.

## Recommended: First Option

Clean, conceptual, introduces "reverse oracles" as the hook. Not too technical, not too salesy. Perfect for company page.
