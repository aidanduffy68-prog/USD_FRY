## If Asked About Timing

**Response:**
"Yeah, the timing is surreal. I built this because I've lost money trading too. Not trying to capitalize on anyone's losses - just wanted to make something that acknowledges that losing is part of trading. The demo's there if anyone wants to test it out."

## General Approach

1. **Acknowledge** the timing without celebrating
2. **Empathize** with people who lost money
3. **Offer** the demo as a tool, not a solution
4. **Focus** on the tech, not the marketing
5. **Be** genuine and understated

The best marketing right now is just being helpful and not being opportunistic.
