# Hyperliquid Builder Pitch - Reverse Oracle for HLP

## Quick LinkedIn Note (Friend of Friend)

Hey [Name],

[Mutual friend] mentioned you're building on HLP.

Quick thought: built a reverse oracle that measures trader retention instead of prices. Could help HLP vaults predict which LPs are sticky vs. mercenary.

Curious if this maps to anything you're working on.

Best,
Aidan

## Why This Works for HLP Builders

**The problem:**
- HLP (Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider) vaults need to differentiate
- Everyone competes on APY, but retention is the real metric
- No way to measure which LPs will stay vs. farm-and-exit

**The pitch:**
- Reverse oracle measures LP behavior (deposits, withdrawals, duration)
- Predicts which LPs are sticky vs. mercenary
- Vaults can optimize incentives for high-LTV providers

**The hook:**
- Hyperliquid's on-chain oracle is great for prices
- But you still need behavioral data for retention
- That's what reverse oracles solve

## Alternative Angle: Trader Retention for HLP Profitability

**HLP makes money when:**
- Traders lose (HLP is the house)
- Traders keep trading (volume = fees)

**HLP loses money when:**
- Traders quit after liquidation (no more volume)
- One-time users don't return

**Reverse oracle value prop:**
- Predict which traders will return post-liquidation
- Allocate retention incentives (FRY, fee rebates) to high-LTV traders
- Maximize HLP long-term profitability
