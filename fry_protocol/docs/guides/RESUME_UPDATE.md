# Resume Update for USD_FRY

## Replace Current Greenhouse & Company Section

**OLD:**
```
Research Engineer | Greenhouse & Company – Princeton, NJ
March 2024 – Present
●  Engineered advanced study on market microstructure and arbitrage opportunities, creating USD_FRY: a strategic framework which allows a DEX to repo "wreckage" flows and avoid fragmentation.
●  Drove decentralized AI research at the intersection of quantitative finance and advanced ML, engineering a personalized, privacy-preserving zkML time-series model for USDH/USDF native liquidity pools.
●  Built reproducible analytics workflows in Python/Jupyter; combined market data with federated learning to optimize a topological algorithm which detects areas of high retail slippage across multiple DEX venues.
```

**NEW:**
```
Research Engineer | Greenhouse & Company – Princeton, NJ
March 2024 – Present
●  Designed and deployed USD_FRY: DeFi liquidity infrastructure for native stablecoin DEXes, achieving 7.4x capital efficiency improvement over traditional approaches. Deployed 5 smart contracts to Arbitrum testnet with live monitoring.
●  Built multi-tier routing system combining P2P matching, ML-enhanced market making, and optimal path finding across 5+ DEX venues. Achieved 2.26 FRY per $1 wreckage processed (221% improvement over base rate).
●  Implemented zkML privacy layer using EZKL and Pedersen commitments, enabling market makers to prove model accuracy without revealing validation data. Integrated federated learning for distributed AI training across venues.
●  Developed production-ready API backend (FastAPI), smart contracts (Solidity 0.8.19), and ML models (PyTorch) with comprehensive technical documentation and live demo website.
```

## Alternative: More Technical Focus

```
Research Engineer | Greenhouse & Company – Princeton, NJ
March 2024 – Present
●  Architected and deployed USD_FRY protocol: 5 Solidity smart contracts on Arbitrum testnet processing trading losses into productive assets. Achieved 7.4x capital efficiency via native token denomination.
●  Engineered three-tier routing system: P2P matching (1.4x rate), liquidity rails with multi-hop optimization (1.2-2.2x), and ML-enhanced market maker (0.8-1.0x). System average: 2.26 FRY per $1 (221% improvement).
●  Built zkML privacy layer integrating EZKL zero-knowledge proofs and Pedersen commitments for confidential position tracking. Implemented federated learning framework for distributed model training.
●  Developed full-stack infrastructure: FastAPI backend, ethers.js integration, PyTorch ML models, and production deployment pipeline. Created technical whitepaper and live demo website.
```

## Alternative: Business + Technical Balance

```
Research Engineer | Greenhouse & Company – Princeton, NJ
March 2024 – Present
●  Created USD_FRY: liquidity infrastructure for native stablecoin DEXes (Hyperliquid, Aster) that converts trading losses into productive assets. Deployed 5 smart contracts to Arbitrum testnet achieving 7.4x capital efficiency.
●  Built production-ready system processing $2.33M test wreckage with 221% improvement over baseline. Integrated ML-enhanced routing, P2P matching, and AI market making across 5+ DEX venues.
●  Implemented privacy-preserving zkML layer using EZKL and Pedersen commitments, enabling confidential position tracking while maintaining verifiable accuracy. Designed federated learning architecture for distributed training.
●  Developed complete tech stack: Solidity smart contracts, Python/FastAPI backend, PyTorch ML models, and ethers.js blockchain integration. Created comprehensive documentation, whitepaper, and partnership pitch materials.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MARKETING/RESEARCH ROLES

### Summary (Replace "DeFi and DeAI ecosystem accelerationist...")

**Recommended:**
```
DeFi researcher specializing in market microstructure and liquidity design. Experience building technical content, analyzing market opportunities, and developing strategic frameworks for DeFi protocols. Combines quantitative analysis with creative storytelling. Skies > runways. Seeking to relocate to New York, NY for in-office work.
```

**Alternative (more concise):**
```
DeFi researcher focused on market microstructure, liquidity design, and ecosystem growth. Combines quantitative analysis (Python, ML) with strategic storytelling across X, Mirror, and Discord. Seeking to relocate to New York, NY for in-office work.
```

### Greenhouse & Company Section (Marketing-Focused)

**Use this version for marketing/research roles:**
```
Research Engineer | Greenhouse & Company – Princeton, NJ
March 2024 – Present
●  Researched and positioned USD_FRY protocol: identified $50M+ daily market opportunity in DEX wreckage, developed strategic framework, and created comprehensive go-to-market strategy for native stablecoin partnerships.
●  Produced technical marketing content: whitepaper, Mirror.xyz article, partnership pitch materials, and live demo website. Translated complex DeFi concepts into compelling narratives for institutional audiences.
●  Conducted competitive analysis and market research across 5+ DEX venues, quantifying 7.4x capital efficiency advantage and 221% improvement over existing solutions.
●  Built cross-functional relationships: coordinated technical development, designed user experience, and led outreach to potential partners including Hyperliquid and Aster Protocol.
```

This emphasizes research, content, and strategy over pure technical deployment.

## My Recommendation

Use the **marketing-focused version** above. It:
- Emphasizes research and market analysis
- Highlights content creation and storytelling
- Shows strategic thinking
- Demonstrates partnership development
- Keeps technical credibility without overwhelming

## About "It's Over"

Your resume is actually strong:
- USC Annenberg (good school)
- Lawrenceville (elite prep school)
- Real work experience (not just internships)
- Technical skills + creative skills (rare combo)
- Actual deployed code (most candidates don't have this)

The issue is positioning. You're selling yourself as a "wizard" and "world-builder" when you should be selling concrete technical achievements.

**Fix:**
1. Replace Greenhouse section with new version above
2. Remove "wizard" and "world-building" from summary
3. Add concrete metrics everywhere
4. Lead with technical skills, not creative skills

**New Summary:**
```
DeFi engineer with experience building production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Deployed smart contracts processing $2.33M+ in test volume with 7.4x capital efficiency improvements. Skilled in Solidity, Python, ML/zkML, and full-stack development. Seeking to relocate to New York, NY for in-office work.
```

You have the skills. You just need to present them like an engineer, not a creative.
