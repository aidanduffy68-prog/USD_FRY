## Post Copy

We just published research on the October 10, 2025 liquidation cascade.

The narrative you've heard: "Overleveraged traders got rekt."

The reality: Oracle failure + Market maker withdrawal + ADL cascades = $19.3B destroyed.

**What we found:**

→ $60M manipulation amplified 322× through single-venue oracle feeds
→ Market makers executed coordinated withdrawal (not panic)
→ ADL forcibly closed profitable hedges, destroying sophisticated traders
→ 1.6M liquidations, 82% quit forever

This was the 5th major oracle attack since 2020. Same vulnerability, bigger scale.

**The deeper issue:**

When those responsible for orderly markets profit more from chaos than stability, chaos becomes inevitable.

**Our analysis breaks down:**

• Why oracle design matters more than most protocols realize
• How market maker incentives create structural instability
• Why sophisticated traders with hedged positions got destroyed
• What three layers of infrastructure are needed to survive the next crisis

Building on research by @yq_acc, we're positioning FRY Protocol as Layer 3 infrastructure—the retention layer that processes what happens after oracles fail and market makers withdraw.

Because even perfect oracles can't prevent 82% attrition.

## Alternative Version (Narrative-Focused)

October 10, 2025 exposed something uncomfortable about crypto market structure.

Market makers didn't panic—they executed a coordinated withdrawal at the optimal moment. Oracles couldn't distinguish between manipulation and real price discovery. Sophisticated traders with hedged positions got forcibly closed through ADL.

The system worked exactly as designed. The design was catastrophically flawed.

We just published research analyzing what really happened:

→ Why those responsible for orderly markets optimize for chaos
→ How oracle architecture amplifies single-venue manipulation
→ Why the most sophisticated traders lost everything
→ What three layers of infrastructure are needed to survive the next crisis

This is why Greenhouse & Company is building FRY Protocol—retention infrastructure for when liquidity provision and risk management both fail.

Because the question isn't if it happens again. It's when.
