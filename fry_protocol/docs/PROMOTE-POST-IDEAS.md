Post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7382842319051608064/

## Organic Reach Tactics

### 1. Cross-Post to Other Platforms
- **Twitter/X**: Thread version with link to LinkedIn post
  - "Just posted on LinkedIn about deploying FRY Protocol the day before the $19B crash..."
  - Tag relevant accounts: @Arbitrum, @chainlink, crypto influencers
  - Use hashtags: #crypto #DeFi #Arbitrum
  
- **Reddit**: 
  - r/CryptoCurrency - "I deployed a protocol the day before the $19B liquidation event"
  - r/defi - Focus on the tech/protocol angle
  - r/ethtrader, r/CryptoMarkets - Trading angle
  - Don't be spammy, engage in comments

- **Hacker News**: 
  - "Show HN: FRY Protocol - Decentralized liquidity infrastructure"
  - Focus on the technical story + timing

### 2. Engage Strategically on LinkedIn
- **Comment on related posts**:
  - Find posts about Oct 10 crash
  - Find posts about Binance/liquidations
  - Add value, then mention your post
  - "I actually built something for this exact problem - [link]"

- **Tag relevant people/companies** (in comments, not original post):
  - Crypto influencers who posted about Oct 10
  - DeFi builders
  - People who engage with your content regularly

- **Ask connections to engage**:
  - DM close friends: "Hey, would appreciate a like/comment on my latest post"
  - Don't spam, just 5-10 people who actually care

### 3. Community Engagement
- **Crypto Discord servers**:
  - Arbitrum Discord
  - DeFi communities
  - Share in #showcase or #projects channels
  - Don't spam, provide context

- **Telegram groups**:
  - DeFi groups
  - Trading communities
  - Share as "built this after Oct 10 crash"

- **Forums**:
  - Bitcointalk
  - Crypto forums
  - Share the story, not just the link

### 4. Content Repurposing
- **Blog post**: Expand the LinkedIn post into full article
  - Medium
  - Dev.to
  - Your own blog
  - Link back to LinkedIn post

- **Video**: 
  - Quick Loom/screen recording walking through the demo
  - Post to YouTube/Twitter
  - "Built this the day before the $19B crash"

- **Infographic**:
  - Timeline: Built → Deployed → Crash happened
  - Share on Twitter/LinkedIn as image post
  - Link to original post in comments

### 5. Leverage the Timing
- **News jacking**:
  - When next big liquidation happens, resurface your post
  - "This is why I built FRY Protocol"
  - Comment on news articles about liquidations

- **Anniversary posts**:
  - "One year ago today, $19B in liquidations..."
  - Link back to original post

### 6. Direct Outreach
- **Email crypto newsletters**:
  - "Hey, I built something interesting around the Oct 10 crash..."
  - Offer to write guest post
  - Share your story

- **Podcast outreach**:
  - Crypto podcasts
  - DeFi podcasts
  - "I deployed to mainnet the day before the biggest crash in history"
  - Good story = good content for them

- **Journalist outreach**:
  - Crypto journalists on Twitter
  - "Interesting angle on the Oct 10 crash..."
  - Offer interview/quote

### 7. Make It Easy to Share
- **Create shareable assets**:
  - Quote cards from your post
  - Stats graphics ($19B, 1.6M traders)
  - Screenshots of the demo
  - Post these separately, link back to main post

- **Tweetable quotes**:
  - "Sometimes you build things not because they'll win, but because they should exist."
  - Make it easy for others to quote/share

### 8. Engage With Everyone Who Comments
- **Reply to every comment** on your LinkedIn post
  - Ask questions back
  - Keep conversation going
  - LinkedIn algorithm loves engagement

- **Thank people who share**:
  - Repost their shares
  - Comment on their posts
  - Build relationships

## The Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Cross-post to Twitter, Reddit (1-2 relevant subs)
- Engage on related LinkedIn posts
- DM 5-10 close connections

**Week 2:**
- Write blog post expansion
- Share in Discord/Telegram communities
- Create shareable graphics

**Week 3:**
- Reach out to 3-5 newsletters/podcasts
- Post to Hacker News
- Create video walkthrough

**Ongoing:**
- Comment on every engagement

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Spam the link everywhere
- ❌ Buy followers/engagement
- ❌ Post in irrelevant communities
- ❌ Be pushy in DMs
- ❌ Ignore comments on your post
- ❌ Only self-promote (give value first)

## The Real Goal

Not just views on the post.

**Get people to:**
1. Visit the demo
2. Try processing a loss
3. Share their experience
4. Come back when they get liquidated

The post is just the entry point. The demo is the product.

## Quick Wins (Do Today)

1. Tweet about the post with link
2. Share in 2-3 relevant Discord servers
3. Comment on 5 related LinkedIn posts
4. DM 3 friends to engage
5. Reply to anyone who's already commented

**Remember:** The story is interesting. The timing is absurd. The demo is fun.

You're not selling. You're sharing a story people want to hear.
