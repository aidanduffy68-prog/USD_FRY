# Prediction Markets + Wreckage Processing

## Core Concept
Use the same wreckage processing infrastructure to handle prediction market losses, turning failed predictions into FRY tokens.

## How It Works

### Traditional Prediction Markets
- User bets $100 that "BTC will hit $100k by EOY"
- Market resolves NO
- User loses $100
- Money goes to winners

### FRY Prediction Markets
- User bets $100 that "BTC will hit $100k by EOY"
- Market resolves NO
- User loses $100 â†’ **Wreckage detected**
- Wreckage processed through liquidity rails
- User receives 226 FRY tokens (2.26x rate)
- Winners get their payout in stablecoins
- FRY tokens backed by prediction market losses

## Technical Integration

### Existing Contracts (Already Deployed)
```solidity
// These contracts already handle wreckage processing
WreckageProcessor.sol
LiquidityRails.sol
FRYToken.sol
AgentB.sol
```

### New Prediction Market Contract
```solidity
contract FRYPredictionMarket {
    // Market creation
    function createMarket(
        string memory question,
        uint256 resolutionTime,
        bytes32[] memory outcomes
    ) external returns (uint256 marketId);
    
    // Betting
    function placeBet(
        uint256 marketId,
        bytes32 outcome,
        uint256 amount
    ) external;
    
    // Resolution
    function resolveMarket(
        uint256 marketId,
        bytes32 winningOutcome
    ) external;
    
    // Wreckage processing (NEW)
    function processLosses(uint256 marketId) external {
        // Calculate total losses
        uint256 totalLosses = calculateLosses(marketId);
        
        // Send to WreckageProcessor
        wreckageProcessor.processWreckage(
            totalLosses,
            losers,
            "PREDICTION_MARKET"
        );
        
        // Mint FRY to losers
        // Pay winners in stablecoins
    }
}
```

## Market Types

### 1. Crypto Price Predictions
- "Will BTC hit $100k by Dec 31?"
- "Will ETH flip BTC in 2025?"
- "Will FARTCOIN reach $1?"

### 2. Trading Outcome Predictions
- "Will I lose money on this XRP trade?"
- "Will my portfolio be down 50% by EOY?"
- "Will I get liquidated this week?"

### 3. Meta Predictions (Recursive)
- "Will I lose this prediction market bet?"
- "Will I process more wreckage this month?"
- "Will my FRY balance increase?"

## Advantages Over Traditional Prediction Markets

### For Losers
- **Get something back**: 226 FRY per $100 lost
- **Quantified losses**: Proof of bad predictions on-chain
- **Gamification**: Leaderboards for worst predictors
- **Community**: "I lost too" solidarity

### For Winners
- **Clean payouts**: Get stablecoins, no complications
- **Liquidity**: FRY backing means deeper markets
- **Arbitrage**: Can buy FRY from losers at discount

### For the Protocol
- **Wreckage flow**: More losses = more FRY minting
- **Capital efficiency**: Same 7.4x efficiency as trading wreckage
- **Market depth**: Losers stay engaged instead of rage-quitting

## User Flow

### Placing a Bet
1. User connects wallet
2. Picks a market: "BTC $100k by EOY?"
3. Bets $100 on YES
4. Market shows: "If wrong, receive 226 FRY"

### Market Resolves (User Lost)
1. Market resolves NO
2. User's $100 is wreckage
3. Automatic processing through liquidity rails
4. User receives 226 FRY tokens
5. Terminal message: "lmao you thought BTC would hit $100k ðŸ’€"

### Market Resolves (User Won)
1. Market resolves YES
2. User receives $180 (1.8x payout)
3. Losers receive FRY
4. Everyone's happy (kinda)

## Demo Integration

### Add to Interactive Demo
```javascript
// New section: Prediction Markets
<div class="prediction-section">
    <h3>ðŸ’€ Prediction Market Wreckage ðŸ’€</h3>
    <p>Lost a bet? Turn it into FRY.</p>
    
    <select id="predictionMarket">
        <option>BTC $100k by EOY</option>
        <option>ETH flips BTC in 2025</option>
        <option>I'll be profitable this month</option>
        <option>My XRP trade will work out</option>
    </select>
    
    <input type="number" placeholder="Bet amount...">
    <button onclick="processPredictionLoss()">I Lost (Process Wreckage)</button>
</div>
```

### Terminal Output
```
> Prediction market loss detected: "BTC $100k by EOY"
> Bet amount: $100
> Outcome: WRONG (obviously)
> Processing through liquidity rails...
> Minted 226 FRY tokens
> Better luck next time (you'll need it)
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

```
FRYPredictionMarket.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ Market creation & management
â”œâ”€â”€ Betting logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Resolution mechanism
â””â”€â”€ Wreckage processing integration
    â”œâ”€â”€ Calls WreckageProcessor.sol
    â”œâ”€â”€ Mints FRY to losers
    â””â”€â”€ Pays winners in stablecoins

WreckageProcessor.sol (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ Receives prediction losses
â”œâ”€â”€ Routes through liquidity rails
â””â”€â”€ Mints FRY at 2.26x rate

LiquidityRails.sol (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ P2P matching
â”œâ”€â”€ Rail routing
â””â”€â”€ AMM fallback
```

## Economic Model

### Loss Distribution
- 70% â†’ FRY minting (losers receive tokens)
- 25% â†’ Winner payouts (stablecoins)
- 5% â†’ Protocol treasury

### FRY Minting Rate
- Same as trading: 2.26 FRY per $1 lost
- Backed by prediction market losses
- Maintains 7.4x capital efficiency

### Market Maker Incentives
- Provide liquidity to markets
- Earn fees on volume
- Receive FRY from protocol treasury

## Snarky Copy Ideas

### Market Descriptions
- "BTC $100k by EOY (copium edition)"
- "Will my bags pump? (narrator: they won't)"
- "Am I a good trader? (we both know the answer)"

### Loss Messages
- "Congrats, you were wrong! Here's 226 FRY"
- "Your prediction skills are as bad as your trading"
- "At least you got FRY out of it"
- "Better luck next time (you'll need it)"

### Market Categories
- "Hopium Markets" (unrealistic predictions)
- "Self-Awareness Markets" (betting on your own failures)
- "Cope Markets" (predictions that help you sleep at night)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Contract Development
- Write FRYPredictionMarket.sol
- Integrate with existing WreckageProcessor
- Deploy to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet
- Test wreckage processing flow

### Phase 2: Demo Integration
- Add prediction markets to interactive demo
- Create sample markets
- Show FRY minting from losses
- Add snarky terminal messages

### Phase 3: Production Launch
- Deploy to Arbitrum mainnet
- Create initial markets
- Marketing campaign
- Community market creation

## Why This Works

### Psychological
- Losing a bet feels better if you get FRY
- Gamifies prediction failures
- Creates community around being wrong
- Reduces rage-quitting

### Economic
- Increases wreckage flow
- More FRY minting = more protocol value
- Winners get clean payouts
- Losers stay engaged

### Technical
- Reuses existing infrastructure
- Same contracts, new use case
- Proven wreckage processing
- 7.4x capital efficiency maintained
