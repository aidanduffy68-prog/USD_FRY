5. Deploy to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet
6. Test on-chain verification
7. Integrate with federated client

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
8. Test with 3+ clients using real market data
9. Optimize proof generation time
10. Measure gas costs on testnet
11. Implement batch verification

### Long-term (Month 1)
12. Deploy to Arbitrum/Optimism mainnet
13. Scale to 5+ venues
14. Monitor performance and costs
15. Iterate based on metrics

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

### Development Costs
- EZKL setup: FREE (open source)
- Testing: FREE (local/testnet)

### Production Costs (per proof)
- Proof generation: FREE (off-chain)
- Ethereum verification: $10-50
- Arbitrum verification: $0.50-2 ‚úÖ Recommended
- Optimism verification: $0.50-2 ‚úÖ Recommended

### Optimization Strategies
- Batch 10 proofs: $0.05-0.20 per proof
- Selective verification: Only new clients
- L2 deployment: 10-20x cheaper
