# Native Stablecoins vs USD_FRY: Complementary Scaling

## The Distinction

### Native Stablecoins (USDF, USDH)
**Purpose**: Scale DEX liquidity and operations

- **USDF (Aster)** - Backs trading, provides settlement layer
- **USDH (Hyperliquid)** - Enables leverage, margin, and trading
- **Function**: Put money INTO the DEX to enable growth
- **Backed by**: Native DEX tokens (ASTER, HYPE)
- **Use case**: Trading capital, collateral, settlement

### USD_FRY Token
**Purpose**: Scale wreckage absorption and loss recycling

- **Function**: Converts losses into productive assets
- **Backed by**: Wreckage (liquidations, slippage, funding losses)
- **Use case**: Incentivize loss absorption, reward liquidity provision
- **Minting**: Based on wreckage processed through the system
- **Denomination**: USD-pegged, wreckage-backed stablecoin

## How They Work Together

### 1. Native Stablecoins Enable Trading
```
USDH/USDF → DEX liquidity → Trading volume → More activity
```

### 2. USD_FRY Absorbs the Wreckage
```
Trading activity → Losses (wreckage) → USD_FRY minting → Productive assets
```

### 3. Positive Feedback Loop
```
More USDH/USDF → More trading → More wreckage → More USD_FRY → 
Better loss absorption → Attracts more liquidity → More USDH/USDF
```

## Example: Hyperliquid

### Without USD_FRY
1. USDH enables $1B in trading volume
2. Trading generates $10M in losses (liquidations, slippage)
3. Losses absorbed by LPs → LPs leave → Volume decreases

### With USD_FRY
1. USDH enables $1B in trading volume
2. Trading generates $10M in losses
3. USD_FRY converts losses → $22.6M USD_FRY minted (2.26x rate)
4. LPs earn USD_FRY → LPs stay → Volume increases
5. Higher HYPE price → More valuable USDH backing → Stronger ecosystem

## The Synergy

### Native Stablecoins (USDF/USDH)
- **Scale the DEX**: More capital → More trading
- **Backed by native token**: Creates token utility
- **Settlement layer**: Enables leverage and margin

### USD_FRY
- **Scale wreckage absorption**: More losses → More USD_FRY
- **Backed by wreckage**: Converts losses to assets
- **Incentive layer**: Rewards loss absorption
- **Stablecoin**: USD-denominated, wreckage-backed

### Together
- **USDF/USDH**: Fuel for the engine (trading capital)
- **USD_FRY**: Exhaust recycling system (loss conversion)
- **Result**: Sustainable growth without LP drain

## Capital Efficiency Advantage

### Traditional DEX (USDC-based)
```
$100M USDC → Trading → $5M losses → LPs absorb → LPs leave
Capital efficiency: 1x (losses are pure cost)
```

### Native Stablecoin DEX (USDF/USDH)
```
$100M USDF/USDH → Trading → $5M losses → Native token backing
Capital efficiency: 2-3x (losses backed by appreciating token)
```

### Native Stablecoin + USD_FRY
```
$100M USDF/USDH → Trading → $5M losses → $11.3M USD_FRY minted
Capital efficiency: 7.4x (losses become productive assets)
```

## Why This Matters

### For DEXes
- **USDF/USDH**: Enables you to scale trading volume
- **USD_FRY**: Enables you to scale without bleeding LPs
- **Combined**: Sustainable growth at 7.4x efficiency

### For Traders
- **USDF/USDH**: Trade with native stablecoin (better rates)
- **USD_FRY**: Earn tokens from your losses (wreckage → USD_FRY)
- **Combined**: Lower costs + rewards for participation

### For LPs
- **USDF/USDH**: Provide liquidity in native stablecoin
- **USD_FRY**: Earn USD_FRY from losses you would normally absorb
- **Combined**: Better risk-adjusted returns

## The USD_FRY Value Proposition

**We don't compete with USDF/USDH - we complement them.**

- USDF/USDH scale the **input** (trading capital)
- USD_FRY scales the **output** (wreckage absorption)

**Together**: Create a closed-loop system where growth strengthens the ecosystem instead of weakening it.

### The Stablecoin Family

## Summary

| Aspect | Native Stablecoins | USD_FRY |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Scale DEX liquidity | Scale wreckage absorption |
| **Backed by** | Native tokens (HYPE, ASTER) | Wreckage (losses) |
| **Function** | Put money IN | Convert losses OUT |
| **Use case** | Trading capital | Loss recycling |
| **Benefit** | More trading volume | Sustainable LP returns |
| **Result** | DEX growth | Loss → productive asset |
| **Type** | Native stablecoin | Wreckage-backed stablecoin |
