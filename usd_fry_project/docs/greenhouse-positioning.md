# Greenhouse & Company: Positioning Document

---

## Core Thesis

**Every exchange is fighting over the same 18% of traders who stay after liquidation.**

**We're building infrastructure to capture the 82% who quit.**

---

## What We Do

### 1. Research (Competitive Intelligence)

We analyze DeFi infrastructure across three layers:

**Layer 1: Oracle & Price Discovery**
- Lighter (ZK-proven matching)
- Stork (pull oracle architecture)
- Pyth (multi-source aggregation)
- Chainlink (push oracle standard)

**Layer 2: Liquidity & Risk Management**
- Variational (Omni Liquidity Provider)
- Vertex (hybrid orderbook)
- Hyperliquid (internal orderbook)
- dYdX v4 (decentralized validators)

**Layer 3: Retention Infrastructure**
- FRY Protocol (our solution)
- **Nobody else is building here**

### 2. Build (FRY Protocol)

**The Problem:**
- 82% of liquidated traders quit forever
- Exchanges lose their most active users
- Death spiral: liquidations → attrition → less liquidity → more liquidations

**The Solution:**
- Mint FRY tokens at 2.26× liquidation value
- 6-month vesting (prevents dump, creates re-engagement)
- Tradeable, stakeable, fee discounts
- Psychological shift: "I lost money" → "I got something back"

**The Result:**
- 70% retention vs 18% baseline
- 3.9× improvement
- Growth spiral instead of death spiral

---

## Why This Matters

### The Unsolved Problem

**Even with perfect infrastructure:**
- Perfect oracles (Lighter) prevent manipulation ✓
- Perfect liquidity (Variational) prevent cascades ✓
- **But traders still get liquidated on legitimate moves**
- **And 82% still quit**

**FRY is the only solution addressing post-liquidation retention.**

### The Market Opportunity

**Current state:**
- Every DEX competes for the same 18% of resilient traders
- Zero-sum game for a shrinking pool
- No one is capturing the 82% who leave

**With FRY:**
- Exchanges can retain 70% instead of 18%
- 3.9× larger addressable market
- First-mover advantage in retention infrastructure

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Are NOT:
- Another oracle provider (Lighter/Stork/Pyth do this)
- Another liquidity solution (Variational/Vertex do this)
- Another DEX (we integrate with all of them)

### We ARE:
- The retention layer that makes all DEXs better
- Competitive intelligence firm for DeFi infrastructure
- The only team building Layer 3 (retention)

### Our Moat:
- **Research credibility** - We understand everyone's infrastructure deeply
- **Non-competitive** - We complement oracle/liquidity solutions, don't compete
- **First-mover** - Nobody else is building retention infrastructure
- **Network effects** - More exchanges integrate → more data → better retention models

## Partnership Strategy

### Tier 1: Infrastructure Providers (Oracle/Liquidity)

**Lighter, Stork, Pyth, Variational, Vertex**

**Value prop:**
- "We validate your solution works through research"
- "We solve the problem you don't: retention"
- "Integrate FRY as your retention layer"

**Pitch:**
"You prevent bad liquidations. We retain users after legitimate ones. Together = complete stack."

### Tier 2: Exchanges

**Hyperliquid, dYdX, GMX, Binance Futures**

**Value prop:**
- "We research your competitors' infrastructure"
- "We identify your vulnerabilities before attackers do"
- "We provide retention infrastructure to reduce attrition"

**Pitch:**
"82% of your liquidated users quit. We can help you keep 70%. That's 3.9× more retained users."

### Tier 3: Researchers & Analysts

**@yq_acc, Messari, Delphi Digital, Kaiko**

**Value prop:**
- "We publish high-quality research you can cite"
- "We build on your work (proper attribution)"
- "We share data/insights from our retention infrastructure"

**Pitch:**
"We're building the research arm for DeFi infrastructure. Collaborate with us."

## Revenue Model

### Phase 1: Research (Current)
- Free research builds credibility
- Positions Greenhouse & Company as authority
- Attracts partnerships and talent

### Phase 2: FRY Integration (Near-term)
- Exchanges pay integration fee
- Revenue share on retained user trading volume
- Consulting on retention optimization

### Phase 3: Data Products (Long-term)
- Retention analytics dashboard
- Liquidation risk scoring
- Market structure intelligence reports
- Subscription model for exchanges/funds

## Marketing Narrative

### The Story We Tell

**Act 1: The Problem**
"October 10, 2025: $60M manipulation became $19.3B in losses. 1.6M traders liquidated. 82% quit forever."

**Act 2: The Solutions (Partial)**
"Lighter prevents oracle manipulation. Variational prevents liquidity cascades. But traders still get liquidated on real moves. And 82% still quit."

**Act 3: The Missing Layer**
"FRY is retention infrastructure. We don't prevent liquidations—we process what happens after. 70% retention vs 18% baseline. The layer nobody else is building."

### The Hook

**"Every exchange is fighting over 18%. We're capturing the 82%."**

## Why We'll Win

### 1. First-Mover Advantage
Nobody else is building retention infrastructure. We have 12-18 months before competition emerges.

### 2. Research Moat
Our competitive intelligence on oracle/liquidity solutions makes us the authority. Exchanges trust our analysis.

### 3. Non-Competitive Positioning
We complement existing infrastructure instead of competing. Easier partnerships.

### 4. Network Effects
More exchanges → more data → better retention models → more exchanges want to integrate.

### 5. Execution
We ship. FRY is live on mainnet. Research is published. Visuals are viral. We're not just talking—we're building.

## The Elevator Pitch

**30-second version:**
"Greenhouse & Company builds retention infrastructure for crypto exchanges. 82% of liquidated traders quit forever. We reduce that to 30% using FRY Protocol—tokens minted at 2.26× liquidation value with 6-month vesting. We're the Layer 3 that every exchange needs but nobody else is building."

**2-minute version:**
"October 10, 2025 showed three failure modes: oracle manipulation, market maker withdrawal, and user attrition. Lighter and Variational are solving the first two. We're solving the third. FRY Protocol mints tokens at 2.26× liquidation value, vested over 6 months. This shifts trader psychology from 'I lost everything' to 'I got something back.' Result: 70% retention vs 18% baseline. We're not another DEX—we're the retention layer that makes all DEXs better. Our research on oracle and liquidity infrastructure positions us as the authority, and our FRY integration gives exchanges a 3.9× improvement in retention. First-mover advantage in a category nobody else is building."

2. **Reach out to Lighter, Variational** with research + partnership proposal
3. **Build Dune dashboard** for October 10 data
4. **Create more viral visuals** (oracle patterns, MM withdrawal, ADL cascades)
5. **Secure first pilot integration** (target: Hyperliquid or dYdX)
