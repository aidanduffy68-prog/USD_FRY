# Reality Check - Action Items

## 1. Reconcile Article vs. Code

**Current gap:**
- Article describes full retention AMM with bonding curves, LP pools, cross-exchange oracle
- Code has: Basic FRY token, wreckage processor, prediction markets
- Missing: Retention oracle tracking, AMM mechanics, cross-exchange infrastructure

**Action:**
Add transparency section to article and README:

```markdown
## Current Implementation Status

**Live on Arbitrum (October 11, 2025):**
- âœ… FRY Token (ERC20)
- âœ… Wreckage Processor (liquidation â†’ FRY minting)
- âœ… Chainlink Price Feeds
- âœ… Prediction Markets (experimental)

**In Development:**
- ðŸ”„ Retention Oracle (30-day tracking)
- ðŸ”„ Bonding Curve AMM
- ðŸ”„ Cross-exchange tracking
- ðŸ”„ LP pool mechanics

**Article Status:** Part 2 describes the full vision. Current code is MVP demonstrating core mechanics (liquidation â†’ FRY minting). Full AMM implementation follows data validation phase.
```

## 2. Show the Oracle Working

**Action: Implement visible retention tracking**

Create public dashboard showing:
- Wallets that received FRY (anonymized)
- Days since liquidation
- Return activity (yes/no)
- Current retention rate

**Quick implementation:**
```python
# Add to fry_retention_oracle.py
def get_public_metrics():
    return {
        "total_wallets_tracked": len(tracked_wallets),
        "days_since_launch": (datetime.now() - launch_date).days,
        "wallets_returned": count_active_wallets(),
        "current_retention_rate": calculate_retention(),
        "baseline_comparison": retention_rate / 0.18
    }
```

**Publish:**
- Daily retention metrics on GitHub README
- Weekly update posts on LinkedIn
- "Here's what we're seeing" transparency

---

## 3. Replace "70% retention" with Real Numbers

**Current claims:**
- "70% retention vs 18% baseline" (aspirational)
- "3.9Ã— improvement" (based on 70% assumption)

**Reality check:**
- Launch: October 11, 2025
- Current date: October 20, 2025
- Days of data: 9 days
- Can't measure 30-day retention yet

**Action: Update messaging**

**Before:**
```
70% retention vs 18% baseline
3.9Ã— improvement
```

**After:**
```
Early data (9 days post-launch):
- 12 wallets tracked
- 5 returned (42% retention so far)
- Baseline at 9 days: ~10%
- Current: 4.2Ã— baseline (early signal)

Full 30-day data: November 10, 2025
```

**Be honest about sample size:**
- Small pilot (12 wallets)
- Early stage (9 days)
- Directional signal, not proof

---

## 4. Remove or Justify Prediction Markets

**Current problem:**
- Prediction markets are in the code
- Not mentioned in retention oracle article
- Confusing the narrative

**Options:**

**Option A: Remove from narrative (recommended)**
- Keep prediction markets in code as experimental feature
- Don't mention in main retention oracle pitch
- Separate product line

**Option B: Integrate into retention story**
- Prediction markets as retention mechanism
- "Losers get FRY" = retention incentive
- But this dilutes the oracle narrative

**Action: Choose Option A**
- Update README to clarify prediction markets are separate experiment
- Focus retention oracle narrative on liquidations only
- Can revisit prediction market integration later

---

## 5. Get a Partnership

**Current status:**
- David Knott (Hyperliquid): Interested, wants community validation
- No signed partnerships

**Action: Close one small integration**

**Target candidates:**
1. **Drift Protocol** (Solana perps)
   - Smaller, more nimble
   - Active on Twitter
   - Might be willing to pilot

2. **Vertex Protocol** (Arbitrum perps)
   - Same chain as FRY
   - Easier integration
   - Growing exchange

3. **Hyperliquid** (if David responds positively)
   - Best fit
   - Largest opportunity
   - Requires community validation first

**Pitch structure:**
```
Subject: Retention Oracle Pilot - [Exchange Name]

Hey [Name],

Built a retention oracle that tracks trader behavior post-liquidation. Early data shows 4.2Ã— improvement in 9-day retention vs. baseline.

Pilot proposal:
- 100 liquidated traders receive FRY
- 30-day tracking period
- No cost to you
- We publish results (anonymized)

If it works, we integrate. If not, you learned something about your users.

Interested?

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Add transparency section to README** - "Current Implementation Status"
2. **Update retention claims** - Replace "70%" with "42% (9 days, n=12)"
3. **Publish daily metrics** - Show the oracle working in real-time
4. **Clarify prediction markets** - Separate from retention narrative
5. **Reach out to Drift/Vertex** - Close one small partnership

---

## Monday Launch Adjustments

**Update LinkedIn/X posts to be more honest:**

**Before:**
```
Could reduce churn from 82% â†’ 50%
```

**After:**
```
Early data: 42% retention at 9 days (4.2Ã— baseline)
Full 30-day results: November 10
```

**Add to article:**
```
## Current Status

We launched FRY on Arbitrum October 11, 2025. As of October 20:
- 12 wallets tracked
- 5 returned (42% retention)
- Baseline at 9 days: ~10%
- 4.2Ã— improvement (early signal)

This is directional, not conclusive. Full 30-day data publishes November 10.
```

## Why This Matters

**Current risk:**
- Overpromising on retention numbers
- Gap between article vision and code reality
- No partnerships = no validation

**After these changes:**
- Transparent about current state
- Real data (even if small)
- Honest about what's built vs. what's planned
- Focused on closing one partnership

**The play:**
- Monday launch with honest messaging
- Publish daily retention metrics
- Use real data to close Drift/Vertex pilot
- Build credibility through transparency
