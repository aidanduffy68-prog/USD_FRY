# 🍟 FRY Protocol: The First Reverse Oracle

---

## The Problem

**82% of liquidated traders quit forever**

- Exchanges lose their most active users
- Death spiral: liquidations → attrition → less liquidity → more liquidations
- $19.3B destroyed on October 10, 2025
- No infrastructure to measure or prevent churn

---

## The Solution

### Traditional oracles predict asset prices.
### Reverse oracles predict trader behavior.

**We built infrastructure to measure and improve retention:**

✓ Track 30-day return rates post-liquidation  
✓ Measure churn signals (inactivity, withdrawals, cross-platform moves)  
✓ Automate FRY incentive allocation based on retention probability  
✓ Self-regulating AMM adjusts pricing based on real outcomes

---

## Early Results
### 9 days post-launch

**12** wallets tracked  
**5** returned (42% retention rate)  
**4.2×** industry baseline (~10% at 9 days)  
**$2,847** FRY distributed at 2.26× liquidation value

## Validation Timeline

**Oct 23, 2025**  
Control group data (10 wallets without FRY)

**Nov 10, 2025**  
Full 30-day retention measurement

**Q1 2026**  
First exchange integration

## Why This Matters

Perfect oracles prevent manipulation. ✓  
Perfect liquidity prevents cascades. ✓  

**But traders still get liquidated and 82% still quit.**

FRY is the retention layer that makes all exchanges better.

## Architecture

**Traditional Oracle:**  
Market Data → Oracle → Smart Contracts  
*Measures external reality*

**Reverse Oracle:**  
User Behavior → Oracle → Retention System  
*Predicts internal behavior*

**Retention AMM:**  
Oracle Data → Bonding Curve → FRY Allocation  
*Automates retention at scale*
