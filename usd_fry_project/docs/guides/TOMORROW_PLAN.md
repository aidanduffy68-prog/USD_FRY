# Tomorrow's Plan: Technical + Portfolio

Mix of Path A (Technical) and Path C (Portfolio) for maximum impact.

---

## Morning Session (2-3 hours)

### 1. Verify Contracts on Arbiscan (30 min)
**Why:** Makes contracts look professional, shows you know deployment best practices

```bash
cd liquidity-rails/core/contracts

# Get API key from: https://arbiscan.io/myapikey
# Add to .env: ARBISCAN_API_KEY=your_key

# Verify all 5 contracts
npm run verify:testnet
```

**Result:** Green checkmarks on Arbiscan, verified source code visible

---

### 2. Add Contract Addresses to Website (30 min)
**Why:** Shows deployment is real, not just mockups

Update `docs/index.html`:
- Add "Deployed Contracts" section
- Link to Arbiscan for each contract
- Show deployment timestamp
- Add "View on Arbiscan" buttons

**Result:** Website shows live, verifiable deployment

---

### 3. Update README with Deployment Info (15 min)
**Why:** First thing recruiters/investors see on GitHub

Add to `README.md`:
```markdown
## 🚀 Deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia

**Live Contracts:**
- USDFRYToken: [0xB6Ce...](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0xB6Ce342D32cEf47bb316f5d2f7c2b39b00916eE0)
- AgentBVerifier: [0x859f...](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x859fe6A2BD2bBF62A0f526F3d11e85C60A617060)
- [+ 3 more]

**Website:** https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/
```

---

### 4. ~~Create LinkedIn Post~~ (SKIP - Already posted)
**Save LinkedIn content for later this week**

---

## Afternoon Session (2-3 hours)

### 5. Run Agent B on Testnet (1-2 hours)
**Why:** Get real performance data, shows system actually works

```bash
cd liquidity-rails/core/engines/agent_b

# Create config with deployed contract addresses
cat > testnet_config.json << EOF
{
  "network": "arbitrum-sepolia",
  "contracts": {
    "usdFryToken": "0xB6Ce342D32cEf47bb316f5d2f7c2b39b00916eE0",
    "router": "0x2C93031141C3284FbccD4b8d1Ac0b8C60a174E23",
    "matchingPool": "0xFB3EB4E31f05097145Fb883ddAC14c528Fe13785"
  },
  "dexes": {
    "hyperliquid": {
      "testnet": true,
      "api_url": "https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz"
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Run Agent B
python3 agent_b_testnet.py testnet_config.json
```

Let it run for 1-2 hours. It will:
- Monitor Hyperliquid funding rates
- Detect wreckage opportunities
- Track FRY minting
- Log performance stats

**Result:** Real data to show in interviews/pitches

---

### 6. Update Resume (30 min)
**Why:** Ready for job applications

Add to resume under Projects:

```
USD_FRY Protocol | Oct 2025
DeFi liquidity infrastructure for native stablecoin DEXes

• Designed and deployed 5 smart contracts to Arbitrum testnet (Solidity, Hardhat)
• Built multi-tier routing system with ML-enhanced market making (Python, PyTorch)
• Implemented zkML privacy layer using EZKL and Pedersen commitments
• Achieved 7.4x capital efficiency improvement over traditional approaches
• Created production-ready API backend (FastAPI) and monitoring dashboard

Tech: Solidity, Python, FastAPI, Hardhat, ethers.js, PyTorch, OpenZeppelin, EZKL

Live: https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/
Code: https://github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/USD_FRY
```

---

### 7. Create Quick Demo Video (30 min)
**Why:** Shows you can communicate technical concepts

Record 2-3 minute screen recording:
1. Show website (30 sec)
2. Show contracts on Arbiscan (30 sec)
3. Explain architecture diagram (60 sec)
4. Show code structure (30 sec)

Use QuickTime or Loom. Upload to YouTube (unlisted).

Add link to README.

## End of Day Checklist

- [ ] Contracts verified on Arbiscan
- [ ] Website updated with contract addresses
- [ ] README updated with deployment info
- [ ] LinkedIn post published
- [ ] Agent B ran for 1-2 hours (collected data)
- [ ] Resume updated
- [ ] Demo video created and linked

---

## What You'll Have

**Portfolio Strength:**
- ✅ Deployed smart contracts (verified)
- ✅ Live website with real addresses
- ✅ Real testnet data from Agent B
- ✅ Demo video explaining architecture
- ✅ LinkedIn post showing you ship
- ✅ Updated resume ready for applications

**This is more than 99% of candidates can show.**

---

## Optional: If You Have Extra Time

**Create Metrics Dashboard:**
```bash
cd liquidity-rails/core/engines/agent_b

# Simple dashboard showing Agent B stats
python3 create_dashboard.py
```

Shows:
- Wreckage processed over time
- FRY minting rate
- Capital efficiency
- System uptime

Makes for great screenshots in applications.

---

## Time Estimate

**Morning:** 2-3 hours
**Afternoon:** 2-3 hours
**Total:** 4-6 hours

**Outcome:** Production-ready portfolio piece that shows technical depth + ability to ship.

---

**Start with contract verification. Everything else builds on that.** 🍟
