# User Acquisition Strategy Post-Oct 10

## The Opportunity

**1.6M traders just got liquidated. They need:**
- A way to process their losses
- Solidarity/community
- Hope that losses aren't total waste
- Alternative to centralized systems that failed them

**You have the solution. Now get it to them.**

---

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Deploy to Mainnet
**Why:** Testnet isn't real. People won't use fake money after losing real money.

**Action:**
```bash
cd liquidity-rails/core/contracts
npm run deploy:mainnet  # Deploy to Arbitrum mainnet
```

**What to deploy:**
- USD_FRY token
- WreckageProcessorWithOracle (Chainlink prices)
- FRYPredictionMarket
- Update demo with mainnet addresses

### 2. Create "Process Your Oct 10 Losses" Campaign

**Landing page:**
```
Lost money on October 10?
Process your wreckage. Get FRY tokens.

‚Ä¢ Enter your loss amount
‚Ä¢ Get Chainlink-verified price
‚Ä¢ Receive FRY at 2.26x rate
‚Ä¢ You're not alone. 1.6M traders lost too.

[Process Wreckage] [Demo]
```

**CTA:** Make it dead simple to input losses and get FRY

### 3. Target the 1.6M Liquidated Traders

**Where they are:**
- r/CryptoCurrency (megathreads about Oct 10)
- Crypto Twitter (search "liquidated" "rekt" "lost everything")
- Discord servers (trading communities)
- Telegram groups (especially altcoin traders)

**What to post:**
```
If you got liquidated on Oct 10, you're not alone.

1.6M traders lost $19B.

I built a system to process trading losses into FRY tokens.
It's live on Arbitrum mainnet.
Chainlink-verified prices.

Not trying to profit from your pain.
Just acknowledging it.

Demo: [link]
```

## Content Strategy

### 1. "I Lost Money Too" Content

**Authenticity is key. Share your own losses:**

**Twitter thread:**
```
I've lost money trading too.

That's why I built $FRY.

Not to celebrate losses.
To acknowledge them.
To process them.
To turn them into something.

If you lost money on Oct 10, the demo is live.
Process your wreckage. Get FRY tokens.

You're not alone. üçü
```

### 2. Educational Content

**Teach people what happened on Oct 10:**

**Blog post:** "What Really Happened on October 10: A $19B Liquidation Breakdown"

- How FRY's decentralized approach prevents this
- CTA: Process your losses

**Video:** Screen recording of demo
- Show real wreckage processing
- Chainlink price verification
- FRY minting
- "This is what we built for"

### 3. Community Building
