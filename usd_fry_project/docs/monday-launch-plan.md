# Monday Launch Plan - AI Reverse Oracles Article

## Timeline (Monday, October 21)

### 9:00 AM EST - LinkedIn Main Post (Personal)
**Post:**
```
The oracle that watches you back. 🪞

What if we built an oracle that predicts trader behavior instead of asset prices?

Traditional oracles: BTC/USD, ETH/USD, market data 📊
Reverse oracles: Will this trader return? What's their LTV? When will they churn? 🪞

Every cascade destroys capital. But the real loss? The traders who never come back.

We built infrastructure to fix this.

**No visual** - saves the Windows 95 graphic for company page repost

**Why 9 AM:**
- Catches East Coast professionals starting their day
- Before market open (9:30 AM)
- High LinkedIn engagement window

### 11:00 AM EST - LinkedIn Comment (Pipeline Visual)
**Comment on your own post:**
```
Architecture determines everything. ⚡

HYPE's single-venue oracle amplified the cascade. 📉
BNB's multi-source validation would have contained it. 🛡️

Same dump. Different outcomes.

Part 2 explores how exchange design creates cascade risk—and what comes next. 🔍

```

**Why 2 hours later:**
- Gives main post time to get initial engagement
- Rewards people who check back
- Second visual = second wave of engagement

### 12:00 PM EST - X/Twitter Thread
**Thread structure:**

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
This one's a doozy. 🔮

We're introducing reverse oracles—the first oracle layer that predicts trader behavior instead of asset prices.

Thread 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
Every oracle in crypto measures asset prices: 📊
• Chainlink → BTC/USD
• Pyth → ETH/USD
• Stork → Market data

Nobody measures: "Will this trader come back after liquidation?" 🤔

82% quit forever. That's the problem. 💔
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Reverse oracles flip the script. 🪞

Instead of measuring markets, they measure you:
• 30-day return rate ⏱️
• Lifetime value (LTV) 💰
• Churn signals 🚨

Then automate retention via AMM mechanics.

This is the missing oracle layer. ✨

**Tweet 4 (Architecture):**
```
Architecture = destiny ⚡

HYPE: single-venue oracle → $19.3B cascade 📉
BNB: multi-source validation → contained 🛡️

Same event. Different design. Different outcome.

Built for the 82% who quit. 🍟
```

**Why noon:**
- Lunch hour = high Twitter engagement
- LinkedIn post has 3 hours of momentum
- Different audience (more builders, less suits)

## Engagement Strategy

**LinkedIn:**
- Respond to every comment within first 2 hours
- Tag relevant people (Stork, Lighter, Variational) in comments if they engage
- Share to relevant groups (DeFi Developers, Crypto Infrastructure)

**X/Twitter:**
- Pin the thread
- Engage with quote tweets
- Drop thread in relevant Discord servers (if appropriate)

**Follow-up:**
- Tuesday: Share key insights as standalone posts
- Wednesday: Respond to any technical questions with detailed threads
- Thursday: Recap engagement, thank contributors

## Backup Plan

**If Meredith responds before Monday:**
- Incorporate her feedback into a follow-up post

- Cross-post to relevant subreddits (r/CryptoCurrency, r/DeFi)
- Share in Telegram/Discord groups

**If engagement is high:**
- Prepare follow-up content (retention AMM deep dive, oracle design patterns)
- Schedule AMA or Twitter Space for later in week
- Reach out to podcasts/newsletters for coverage
