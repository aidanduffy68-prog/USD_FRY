# Echo — Network Coordination Detection Engine

**AI-Powered Collective Behavioral Pattern Detection**

## Overview
Echo identifies collective behavioral patterns, coordination rings, and facilitator networks. Detects when multiple actors are working together.

## Core Capabilities
- **Coordination Detection** — Identify when actors are coordinating
- **Network Mapping** — Map facilitator networks and coordination rings
- **Pattern Matching** — Detect mimicry patterns and behavioral clustering
- **Cross-Chain Tracking** — Track coordination across multiple chains

## Integration
- **Visual Assets** — `echo/visuals/` contains ABC pipeline graphics, behavioral graphs, BTC settlement flow, and operational metrics
- **Relationship Inference** — Enhanced with AI-powered relationship inference (see `nemesis/ai_ontology/relationship_inference.py`)
