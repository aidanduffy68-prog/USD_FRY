# AI-Powered Threat Ontology Upgrade
**Making ABC Undeniable**

## What Changed

The Adversarial Behavior Compiler (ABC) is now positioned as an **AI-powered threat ontology**, not just a compiler. This transforms it from a rule-based system into a self-evolving intelligence platform.

## Key Additions

### 1. AI Threat Ontology Specification
**File:** `nemesis/AI_THREAT_ONTOLOGY_SPEC.md`

Complete technical specification covering:
- Semantic understanding layer (LLM-based entity extraction)
- Auto-classification system (threat actors, TTPs, campaigns)
- Relationship inference engine (graph neural networks)
- AI-powered Hades (behavioral signature generation)
- Predictive threat modeling
- Continuous learning system
- Natural language threat intelligence

### 2. Integration Roadmap
**File:** `nemesis/AI_ONTOLOGY_INTEGRATION.md`

Implementation checklist with 4 phases:
- Phase 1: Foundation (LLM integration, basic classification)
- Phase 2: Core AI Features (predictive modeling, NL interface)
- Phase 3: Learning & Evolution (feedback loops, ontology expansion)
- Phase 4: Production (deployment, optimization)

### 3. Updated Documentation
- `nemesis/README.md` — Now reflects AI-powered ontology positioning
- Main README — Will be updated to highlight AI capabilities

## Why This Makes ABC Undeniable

1. **Self-Evolving** — Learns new threats without manual updates
2. **Predictive** — Forecasts actions, not just analyzes history
3. **Comprehensive** — Discovers hidden relationships humans miss
4. **Scalable** — Handles thousands of threat actors automatically
5. **Natural** — Analysts query in plain English
6. **Continuous** — Gets smarter with every detection

## Next Steps

1. Update main README to highlight AI capabilities
2. Update whitepaper positioning (if exists)
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (LLM integration)
4. Create MVP semantic understanding layer

*Status: Foundation complete. Ready for implementation.*
