# Nemesis — Pre-emptive Targeting Engine

**AI-Powered Threat Ontology for On-Chain Economic Warfare**

## Overview
Nemesis is the pre-emptive targeting engine that transforms the Adversarial Behavior Compiler (ABC) from a rule-based system into an **AI-powered threat ontology**. It learns, evolves, and provides deeper intelligence than any manual approach.

## Core Components

### AI-Powered Threat Ontology
- **Semantic Understanding** — LLM-based entity extraction from unstructured intelligence
- **Auto-Classification** — ML models categorize threat actors, TTPs, and campaigns
- **Relationship Inference** — Graph neural networks discover hidden connections
- **Predictive Modeling** — Forecast adversary actions before they occur
- **Continuous Learning** — System improves from feedback and new data
- **Natural Language Interface** — Query threat intelligence in plain English

### Threat Intelligence Outputs
- **Threat Actor Dossiers** — AI-generated profiles (see `threat_profiles/`)
- **Targeting Packages** — Executable intelligence with confidence scores
- **Predictive Forecasts** — Next-move predictions with timing windows
- **Network Maps** — Coordination rings and facilitator networks

## Files

- `ABC_BEHAVIORAL_INTELLIGENCE_WHITEPAPER.md` — Complete technical specification
- `AI_THREAT_ONTOLOGY_SPEC.md` — AI-powered ontology architecture
- `AI_ONTOLOGY_INTEGRATION.md` — Implementation roadmap
- `threat_profiles/` — Operational threat dossiers (e.g., Lazarus Group)

## Integration

Nemesis integrates with:
- **Hades** — Behavioral profiling engine
- **Echo** — Coordination detection engine
- **Hypnos** — Long-term memory & pattern consolidation engine
- **Bitcoin Settlement Layer** — Automated bounty payouts
