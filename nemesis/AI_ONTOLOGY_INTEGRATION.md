# AI Ontology Integration Plan
**Making ABC Undeniable Through AI-Powered Threat Intelligence**

## Executive Summary
Transform the Adversarial Behavior Compiler from a rule-based system into an **AI-powered threat ontology** that learns, evolves, and provides deeper intelligence than any manual approach.

---

## Key Transformations

### Before (Compiler)
- Rule-based pattern matching
- Manual threat classification
- Static ontology schema
- Reactive intelligence

### After (AI-Powered Ontology)
- AI-driven pattern discovery
- Auto-classification of threats
- Self-evolving ontology
- Predictive intelligence

---

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Create AI Threat Ontology Specification (`AI_THREAT_ONTOLOGY_SPEC.md`)
- [ ] Update whitepaper positioning (ABC as AI-powered ontology)
- [ ] Design semantic understanding layer architecture
- [ ] Set up LLM integration pipeline

### 🔄 Phase 2: Core AI Features
- [ ] Implement auto-classification system
- [ ] Build graph neural network for relationship inference
- [ ] Create AI-powered Hades behavioral signature generation
- [ ] Develop predictive threat modeling system
- [ ] Build natural language query interface

### ⏳ Phase 3: Learning & Evolution
- [ ] Design continuous learning feedback loops
- [ ] Implement automated ontology expansion
- [ ] Create model retraining pipeline
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

### ⏳ Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Integrate AI layer with existing Hades/Echo/Nemesis
- [ ] Update Behavioral Intelligence Graph schema
- [ ] Create API endpoints for AI-powered queries
- [ ] Production deployment and optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Update Whitepaper** — Reframe ABC as AI-powered threat ontology
2. **Update Ontology Spec** — Add AI-powered entity extraction and classification
3. **Create Technical Architecture Doc** — Detail AI model stack and data flow
4. **Build MVP** — Start with semantic understanding layer

---

## Why This Makes ABC Undeniable

1. **Self-Evolving** — Learns new threats without manual updates
2. **Predictive** — Forecasts actions, not just analyzes history
3. **Comprehensive** — Discovers hidden relationships humans miss
4. **Scalable** — Handles thousands of threat actors automatically
5. **Natural** — Analysts query in plain English
6. **Continuous** — Gets smarter with every detection
