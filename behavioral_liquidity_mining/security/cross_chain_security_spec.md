# Cross-Chain Intelligence Security Layer: Comprehensive Specification

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture Overview

The cross-chain behavioral intelligence system requires multi-layered security to protect:

- **Cross-Chain Communications**: Secure data transmission between chains
- **Prediction Integrity**: Prevent manipulation of behavioral predictions
- **Financial Security**: Protect against alpha extraction attacks
- **System Resilience**: Maintain uptime during attacks

## üîê Layer 1: Behavioral Data Privacy Security

### Zero-Knowledge Behavioral Proofs
**Concept**: Prove behavioral patterns exist without revealing individual trader data

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class ZKBehavioralProof:
    def __init__(self):
        self.proving_key = None
        self.verification_key = None
    
    def generate_behavioral_proof(self, wallet_address, behavioral_pattern):
        """
        Generate ZK proof that wallet exhibits behavioral pattern
        without revealing wallet address or specific behavioral data
        """
        # Use zk-SNARKs to prove pattern existence
        # Commit to behavioral data using Pedersen commitments
        # Generate proof without revealing private inputs
        pass
    
    def verify_pattern_proof(self, proof, public_inputs):
        """

        """
        # Verify ZK proof using verification key
        # Ensure pattern exists without learning specifics

        """
        Add Laplace noise to behavioral aggregations
        Prevents individual identification in group statistics
        """
        scale = sensitivity / self.epsilon
        noise = np.random.laplace(0, scale)
        return true_value + noise
    
    def private_behavioral_clustering(self, behavioral_data):
        """

        """
